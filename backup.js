      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>The types of graven, or "carved," images that are sinful to make are ones that are made to be worshipped. The golden cherubin were not made to be worshipped, so they are not "images."</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether it is a sin to make graven, or "carved," images. God says it is a sin, yet He also commands the making of golden cherubims, which appear to be carved images. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n  \n  <h4>Should not make graven images</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 20:4-5</strong> - 4 “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me.</blockquote>\n\n  <blockquote><strong>Leviticus 26:1</strong> - “You shall not make idols for yourselves or erect an image or pillar, and you shall not set up a figured stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the Lord your God."</blockquote>\n\n  <blockquote><strong>Deuteronomy 5:8</strong> - "You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."</blockquote>\n\n  <blockquote><strong>Deuteronomy 27:15</strong> - "‘Cursed be the man who makes a carved or cast metal image, an abomination to the Lord, a thing made by the hands of a craftsman, and sets it up in secret.’ And all the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen.’"</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>Make graven images</h4>\n\n  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 25:18</strong> - And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of hammered work shall you make them, on the two ends of the mercy seat.</blockquote>\n\n  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 37:7-8</strong> - 7 And he made two cherubim of gold. He made them of hammered work on the two ends of the mercy seat, 8 one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end. Of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim on its two ends.</blockquote>\n\n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n\n  <h4>The types of graven, or "carved," images that we should not make are ones that we worship</h4>\n\n  <p>The phrase, "graven/carved image," has a specific definition. Specifically, it is something that a person worships or serves.</p>\n\n  <p>Exodus 20:4-5 says concerning these images, "You shall not bow down to them or serve them." So, we are not to make any image that we would worship or serve.</p>\n\n  <p>Similarly, Leviticus 26:1 says that we should not make a graven image "to bow down to it."</p>\n\n  <h4>The golden cherubim were not worshipped or served</h4>\n\n  <p>The golden cherubim that God commanded the Israelites to make were not used for worship or service, but were rather made to be a representation of heaven. Essentially, they were used as decoration and <strong>for</strong> worship, not to <strong>be</strong> worshipped.</p>\n\n  <p>Furthermore, the cherubim were located in the Holy of Holies in the temple by the mercy seat, which would not have been a public place of worship. So, Israelites would not have been tempted to worship these cherubim.</p>\n</div>',

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>There are at least five possible explanations:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n    <li>"All" may not refer to every single animal (see Matthew 3:5, Mark 1:5).</li>\n    <li>The Egyptians gained livestock between verses 1-7 and verses 18-21.</li>\n    <li>Only livestock "in the field" were killed, so some livestock survived.</li>\n    <li>Verses 1-7 do not mention one important animal: the goat. It is possible that goats were not killed in verses 1-7.</li>\n    <li>In verses 19-20, those who "feared the word of the Lord" were warned about the coming plague. Perhaps some were warned during the plague in verses 1-7 also.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether all of the livestock died in Exodus 9:1-7. Exodus 9:1-7 says that all of the livestock died, but Exodus 9:18-21 implies that not all of the livestock died. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n  \n  <h4>All of the livestock died</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 9:1-7</strong> - 9 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, “Let my people go, that they may serve me. 2 For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them, 3 behold, the hand of the Lord will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field, the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks. 4 But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die.” 5 And the Lord set a time, saying, “Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land.” 6 And the next day the Lord did this thing. <strong>All the livestock of the Egyptians died</strong>, but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died. 7 And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>Not all of the livestock died</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 9:18-21</strong> - 18 Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. 19 <strong>Now therefore send, get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter, for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them</strong>.” 20 Then whoever feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses, 21 but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the Lord left his slaves and his livestock in the field.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>There are five reasonable explanations that eliminate this alleged contradiction:</p>\n  \n  <h3>1. The word "all" does not refer to every single animal</h3>\n  \n  <p>The word "all" does not always refer to every single person or animals, but sometimes refers to a great majority. For example, take a look at Matthew 3:5 and Mark 1:5.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>Then Jerusalem and <strong>all Judea and all the region</strong> about the Jordan were going out to him... (Matthew 3:5)</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote>And <strong>all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem</strong> were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. (Mark 1:5)</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Clearly, not "all" Judea went out to Jesus as in every single individual in Judea. These passages are clearly saying that a great majority of the people in Judea was going out to Jesus.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is entirely possible that "all the livestock" in Exodus 9:1-7 conveys a similar meaning.</p>\n  \n  <h4>2. The Egyptians took livestock from the Israelites, or acquired more livestock through another means</h4>\n  \n  <p>The second possibility is that the Egyptians acquired more livestock between Exodus 9:1-7 and Exodus 9:18-21, whether from the Israelites, who did not lose their livestock, or from another source.</p>\n  \n  <p>If this was the case, then the hail would have killed all the livestock that the Egyptians had gained between the two plagues.</p>\n  \n  <h4>3. Only the livestock "in the field" were killed</h4>\n  \n  <p>Exodus 9:3 says that the plague would be upon "your livestock that are in the field." So, perhaps only the livestock in the field died, and the livestock that were not in the field did not die that day.</p>\n  \n  <p>Then, again, in Exodus 9:18-21, any livestock in the field would have died during the hail.</p>\n  \n  <h4>4. Goats did not die during the first plague</h4>\n  \n  <p>Interestingly, verses 1-7 do not mentioned one important animal that was used as livestock: the goat. It is possible that all the livestock mentioned, but not goats, were killed in the fifth plague, and then goats were killed in the following plague.</p>\n  \n  <h4>5. Perhaps those who "feared the word of the Lord" were warned so that their livestock did not die</h4>\n  \n  <p>In verses 19-20, we see that those who "feared the word of the Lord" were warned to get their livestock out of the fields and into "safe shelter" so that their livestock would be spared.</p>\n  \n  <p>Perhaps there were those who feared God and not Pharaoah who God had mercy on, during both plagues.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p>Any of these five explanations would resolve the alleged contradiction. There is simply no contradiction between these passages concerning whether all of the Egyptians\'s livestock died.</p>\n</div>',

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>All sin deserves death and hell, so God is doing nothing wrong when He puts Onan to death for refusing to obey His command to further the line of his brother Er, who, we might note, was also put to death by God for his wickedness.</p>\n  \n  <p>Furthermore, Onan\'s sin would have been considered much more serious in Israel\'s culture than what we might think of his sin today.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that God was wrong to put Onan to death for merely "wasting his semen on the ground." Here is the relevant passage:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 38:6-10</strong> - 6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 7 But Er, Judah\'s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord put him to death. 8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother\'s wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” 9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother\'s wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother. 10 And what he did was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and he put him to death also.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <h4>All sin deserves death</h4>\n  \n  <p>In Romans 6:23, Paul writes that "the wages of sin is death," and in James 2:10, James writes that "whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it." From these passages, we learn that the punishment for sin is death, and that committing even just one sin makes a person guilty of the entire law.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, God was fully justified in putting Onan to death for refusing to obey His command to help further the line of his brother Er. God is not wrong at all to do this because all sin is serious and all sin is fully deserving of death.</p>\n  \n  <p>The fact that most humans are not put to death immediately for their sin is a sign of God\'s mercy and grace. God holds off on giving most humans the punishment they deserve to give them time to be saved through repentance and faith. However, God does nothing wrong when He chooses to punish a person for sin before that person naturally dies.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Israel\'s culture was different than ours</h4>\n  \n  <p>Something else to keep in mind is that Israel\'s culture was different than ours in that having offspring was extremely important to the Israelites.</p>\n  \n  <p>In Israel\'s culture, if a man died without any children, the next of kin sometimes had the responsibility to "go in" to the wife and produce children, who would be regarded as children of the husband who had died. These children would be able to care for their mother and produce offpsring of their own, furthering the line of the deceased husband.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, it would have been a serious issue for a man to refuse to help further the line of his deceased brother. It was much more serious back then than it sounds now.</p>\n</div>',

At the same time, he sinned when he offered his daughters to the crowd of men in Genesis 19:8.</p>\n  \n  <p>Likewise, David is described as a righteous man throughout the Bible, yet he committed a horrendous sin in committing adultery with Bathsheba and then causing the death of her husband Uriah.</p>\n  \n  <p>The fact that a person can be considered righteous despite heinous sin is a testimony of God's grace and forgiveness. Through Jesus' atoning work, one's heinous sins can be completely washed away.</p>\n</div>",

So, because Adam sinned, all humans, including all women, are now also guilty of sin, and one of the consequences of this sin is pain in childbearing.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Original sin is not unfair</h4>\n  \n  <p>Our instinctive reaction against the doctrine of original sin is that it is unfair. However, this is because we are evaluating God\'s decrees by human standards, which are flawed, and not by God\'s standards, which are right.</p>\n  \n  <p>Original sin is not unfair simply because it is part of God\'s will and decree. God created Adam to be the "head," or representative, of all mankind, and we have no grounds upon which to object against this decision of God.</p>\n  \n  <p>Paul responds to those who would object against God\'s decree by writing this:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?"</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>In other words, God has the right to make Adam our representative head simply because He is the creator and we are not.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p>God causing all women to have pain in childbearing because of the sin of Adam and Eve is not immoral because sin has consequences and because Adam was the representative head of all mankind. This means that every human after Adam would inherit a sin nature, and part of this sin nature involves women experiencing pain in childbirth.</p>\n</div',

We do this in order to cause the person to reflect upon the question and learn something as a result of this reflection.</p>\n  \n  <h4>What did God want to teach Adam with His question?</h4>\n  \n  <p>God wanted to teach Adam something by asking the question, "Where are you?" The context of Genesis 3:9 is that Adam had just sinned by eating the forbidden fruit and was hiding from God.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, the purpose of God\'s question to Adam probably also had a spiritual aspect to it. Perhaps the intent of God\'s question to Adam was something like this:</p>\n  \n  <p>"Why are you hiding from me? Are you still in fellowship with me, or are you in rebellion against me?"</p>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p>There is clearly no contradiction between Genesis 3:9 and God\'s omniscience. God simply had a reason why He would ask Adam such a question.</p>\n</div>',

      "\n <div class=\"writing\">\n <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n \n <p>Matthew and Luke clearly have different objectives with their genealogies, so we should expect differences. Here are two possible explanations for the differences:</p>\n \n <ol>\n    <li>Luke's genealogy may be tracing Jesus' lineage through Mary</li>\n    <li>Matthew's may be a biological genealogy, while Luke's may be a legal genealogy</li>\n  </ol>\n \n <h3>The alleged contradiction</h3>\n\n <p class=\"first\">At first glace, the genealogies of Matthew and Luke appear to be contradictory. Matthew's genealogy traces Jesus back through David's son Solomon, and Luke's genealogy traces Jesus back through David's son Nathan. Also, Matthew states that Joseph's father is Jacob, and Luke states that Joseph's father is Heli.</p>\n \n <h4>Matthew's genealogy</h4>\n\n <blockquote><strong>Matthew 1:6</strong> - And <strong>David was the father of Solomon</strong> by the wife of Uriah...</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote><strong>Matthew 1:16</strong> - and <strong>Jacob the father of Joseph</strong> the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</blockquote>\n \n <h4>Luke's genealogy</h4>\n \n <blockquote><strong>Luke 3:23</strong> - Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of <strong>Joseph, the son of Heli</strong>...</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote><strong>Luke 3:31</strong> - the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of <strong>Nathan, the son of David</strong>...</blockquote>\n\n <h3>Several possible explanations for the apparent contradiction</h3>\n\n <p class=\"first\">The seeming discrepancies between Matthew and Luke's genealogies are definitely not certain contradictions. There are several good reasons to believe that there is no contradiction between the two authors.</p>\n\n <h4>Matthew and Luke clearly have different objectives with their genealogies</h4>\n\n <p class=\"first\">The most significant factor to consider is that it is clear that Matthew and Luke are not trying to accomplish the same things with their genealogies. Here are some significant differences:</p>\n\n <p></p>\n \n <ol>\n <li>Matthew begins his genealogy with Abraham, which suggests he is writing to a primarily Jewish audience, whereas Luke begins his genealogy with Adam, which suggests a broader audience that includes Gentiles.</li>\n <li>Matthew's genealogy occurs at the very beginning, whereas Luke's genealogy occurs later in the book, after Mary has been introduced, which makes it possible that Luke is actually tracing Jesus back through Mary, instead of Joseph.</li>\n </ol>\n\n <p>The fact that Matthew and Luke's genealogies clearly have different purposes and themes helps us approach the differences between them with the question, \"<strong>Why</strong> are they different?\", rather than with the declaration, \"They are contradictory.\"</p>\n\n <h4>Luke's genealogy may be of Mary's</h4>\n\n <p class=\"first\">One possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy between the two genealogies is that Matthew's genealogy is of Joseph's, while Luke's genealogy is of Mary's. There was no Greek word for \"son-in-law,\" so perhaps Joseph was the \"son of Heli\" in the sense that he was married to Mary, Heli's daughter. Then, Joseph would have descended from David's son Solomon, while Mary would have descended from David's son Nathan.</p>\n\n <p>Although it would have been unusual to trace a genealogy through a mother's side (Mary's side), Mary was an extraordinary woman. Furthermore, Luke's genealogy does not occur until later in the book, after Luke has introduced Mary and told part of the story from her point of view.</p>\n\n <h4>Eusebius's explanation</h4>\n\n <p class=\"first\">Another possible explanation, which was held by the church historian Eusebius, is that Matthew's genealogy is a biological genealogy, while Luke's genealogy is legal genealogy. In Jewish tradition, if a man died without having any sons, his brother would marry the widow and have a son who could carry on the family name. Eusebius noted that Melchi (<span class=\"scripture\">Luke 3:24</span>) and Matthan (<span class=\"scripture\">Matthew 1:15</span>) were both married to the same woman at different times, which would make Heli (<span class=\"scripture\">Luke 3:23</span>) and Jacob (<span class=\"scripture\">Matthew 1:15</span>) half-brothers.</p>\n\n <p>Then, perhaps, when Heli died without a son, his half-brother Jacob married Heli's widow. This would mean that Joseph is <em>legally</em> the son of Heli, but <em>biologically</em> the son of Jacob. Then, Jacob would be the descendent of Solomon, and Heli would be the descendent of Nathan.</p>\n\n <h4>We should give Matthew and Luke the benefit of the doubt</h4>\n\n <p class=\"first\">Because of all of the factors listed above, we should assume that Matthew and Luke would not write genealogies that are so directly contradictory. It is likely that they would have been able to double-check their facts, especially because genealogies were extremely important to the Jews. Furthermore, it is likely they used similar sources, and perhaps even communicated with one another, before writing their genealogies, in which case it would be silly to believe that they would write contradictory genealogies.</p>\n </div>\n",

      '<div class="writing">\n <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n <p>The stone was rolled away before the women arrived at the tomb. "had occurred" may be a better translation of the passage, and the purpose of the passage would be to explain the lack of guards at the tomb when the women arrived.</p>\n\n <h3>The argument</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Some argue that the gospel resurrection accounts are contradictory concerning whether the stone was already rolled away when the women arrived at the tomb. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n \n <h4>Stone rolled away after the women arrived?</h4>\n\n <blockquote><strong>Matthew 28:1-5 NASB</strong> - Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave. And behold, <strong>a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it</strong>. And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men. The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified."</blockquote>\n \n <h4>Stone rolled away before the women arrived</h4>\n\n <blockquote><strong>Mark 16:3-4</strong> - And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?" And looking up, <strong>they saw that the stone had been rolled back</strong>&mdash;it was very large.</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote><strong>Luke 24:2 - And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb</strong>...</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote><strong>John 20:1</strong> - Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and <strong>saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb</strong>.</blockquote>\n\n <p>The apparent contradiction here is that while Mark, Luke, and John write that the stone was <strong>already</strong> rolled away when the women arrived at the tomb, Matthew appears to be saying that the stone was rolled away <strong>after</strong> the women arrived. Also, Matthew includes details about an earthquake, while the other gospels do not.</p>\n\n <h3>A reasonable explanation</h3>\n\n <p class="first">It would be reasonable to believe that the earthquake, the angel coming, the stone being rolled away, the angel sitting on the stone, and the guards fainting and/or fleeing all happened before the women arrived at the tomb. The NASB translation, quoted above, uses the verb "had occurred," rather than "there was," which suggests that the events in verses 2-4 occurred before the women arrived at the tomb.</p>\n\n <p>It would make sense for Matthew to be using verses 2-4 to provide extra context regarding the scene that the women encountered when they arrived at the tomb. Verses 2-4 would help explain the lack of guards at the tomb when the women arrived.</p>\n\n <p>Thus, in all four accounts, the stone would have been rolled away <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb.</p>\n \n <h3>General notes</h3>\n\n <h4>The differences between the gospels point to their authenticity</h4>\n\n <p class="first">What would actually be <em>more</em> suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.</p>\n\n <p>However, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself. So, rather than producing doubt, the differences between the gospel accounts should actually make us more confident in the historicity of the resurrection accounts.</p>\n \n <h4>It is perfectly normal for eyewitness accounts to differ</h4>\n \n <p class="first">Not every witness to an event recalls all of the details perfectly, or in the exact same way, so we should expect various accounts of the resurrection events to differ from one another.</p>\n \n <h4>The key is that there are no irreconcilable contradictions</h4>\n \n <p class="first">As long as we can provide <strong>possibilities</strong> for how the various resurrection accounts could reconcile into one coherent narrative, then there would be no irreconcilable, or necessary contradiction. This would then allow us to continue believing in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible without any compromise.</p>\n \n <h4>"But, I\'m not convinced by your explanations. I still think these are irreconcilable contradictions."</h4>\n \n <p class="first">It\'s likely that non-believers won\'t accept the possible explanations that we provide concerning reconciling the apparent contradictions in the resurrection narratives. However, their refusal to accept these explanations is not based upon the fact that reasonable and possible explanations have been provided, but simply upon the fact that they don\'t <strong>want</strong> to believe that there are legitimately reasonable and possible explanations.</p>\n \n <p>Their goal is simply to continue justifying their unbelief in the Bible, regardless of any fact or explanation provided to them. So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do. We should inform them that they are being unreasonable and stubborn, and that they are simply trying to shut their minds to the truth.</p>\n</div>',

And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</blockquote>\n\n  <h4>Jesus appeared first to Mary alone</h4>\n <blockquote><strong>John 20:2-14</strong> - So she [Mary Magdelene] ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him." So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb... Then the disciples went back to their homes.\n <br /><br />\n But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him." Having said this, <strong>she turned around and saw Jesus standing</strong>, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Matthew seems to write that Jesus\' first appearance was to a group of women, and John seems to write that Jesus\' first appearance was to Mary Magdelene alone.</p>\n\n <h3>A reasonable explanation</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Jesus appeared first to Mary Magdelene alone at the tomb, and then he later appeared to the rest of the women as they were traveling back to Bethany. Here are some additional details:</p>\n \n <p>Upon seeing the stone rolled away from the tomb, Mary Magdelene had separated from the other women she was with to go tell Peter and John, who were not staying in Bethany, which was where most of the other disciples were staying.</p>\n\n <p>After the rest of the women left the tomb, Mary, Peter, and John arrived at the tomb. After Peter and John left the tomb, Mary stayed, and then Jesus appeared <strong>first</strong> to Mary Magdelene at the tomb. Then, after Mary went to go tell the disciples that she had seen Jesus, Jesus appeared <strong>second</strong> to the rest of the women while they were on their way to Bethany to tell the other disciples.</p>\n \n <p>It is also possible that Jesus appeared first to the group of women, and then to Mary alone. The important point is that they were separate appearances.</p>\n \n <h3>General notes</h3>\n\n <h4>The differences between the gospels point to their authenticity</h4>\n\n <p class="first">What would actually be <em>more</em> suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.</p>\n\n <p>However, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself. So, rather than producing doubt, the differences between the gospel accounts should actually make us more confident in the historicity of the resurrection accounts.</p>\n \n <h4>It is perfectly normal for eyewitness accounts to differ</h4>\n \n <p class="first">Not every witness to an event recalls all of the details perfectly, or in the exact same way, so we should expect various accounts of the resurrection events to differ from one another.</p>\n \n <h4>The key is that there are no irreconcilable contradictions</h4>\n \n <p class="first">As long as we can provide <strong>possibilities</strong> for how the various resurrection accounts could reconcile into one coherent narrative, then there would be no irreconcilable, or necessary contradiction. This would then allow us to continue believing in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible without any compromise.</p>\n \n <h4>"But, I\'m not convinced by your explanations. I still think these are irreconcilable contradictions."</h4>\n \n <p class="first">It\'s likely that non-believers won\'t accept the possible explanations that we provide concerning reconciling the apparent contradictions in the resurrection narratives. However, their refusal to accept these explanations is not based upon the fact that reasonable and possible explanations have been provided, but simply upon the fact that they don\'t <strong>want</strong> to believe that there are legitimately reasonable and possible explanations.</p>\n \n <p>Their goal is simply to continue justifying their unbelief in the Bible, regardless of any fact or explanation provided to them. So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do. We should inform them that they are being unreasonable and stubborn, and that they are simply trying to shut their minds to the truth.</p>\n</div>',

      '<div class="writing">\n <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n \n <p>It would be reasonable to believe that the angels were sitting when the women entered the tomb, and then stood up after that. The angel in Matthew was sitting on the stone before the women arrived at the tomb, and had moved into the tomb by the time the women arrived at the tomb.</p>\n \n <h3>The argument</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Some argue that the gospel resurrection accounts are contradictory concerning whether the angels were sitting or standing when the women met them. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n \n <h4>Sitting on the stone</h4>\n\n <blockquote><strong>Matthew 28:2-5</strong> - And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone <strong>and sat on it</strong>. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."</blockquote>\n \n <h4>Sitting in the tomb</h4>\n\n <blockquote><strong>Mark 16:5-6</strong> - And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. And he said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him."</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote><strong>John 20:12-13</strong> - And she saw two angels in white, <strong>sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet</strong>. They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him."</blockquote>\n \n <h4>Standing in the tomb</h4>\n \n <blockquote><strong>Luke 24:2-6</strong> - And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when <strong>they went in</strong> they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold, <strong>two men stood by them</strong> in dazzling apparel. And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?</blockquote>\n\n <p>Was there an angel sitting on a stone, a young man sitting on the right side inside the tomb, two men standing by the women, or one angel at the head and another at the feet of where Jesus had lain? The apparent contradiction is that whereas Matthew writes that an angel sat on the stone, the other three gospels say that the angels were inside the tomb.</p>\n\n <h3>A reasonable explanation</h3>\n\n <p class="first">In Matthew, what we know is that the angel was sitting on the stone when the guards saw him, and "for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men." It is reasonable to believe that after this happened, the angel in Matthew did not remain on the stone, but rather met the women when they went inside the tomb, as the other gospels report. Matthew simply does not tell us what occurs between when the guards responded to seeing the angel and when the women met the angel.</p>\n\n <p>Regarding whether the angels were sitting or standing when the women met them inside the tomb, one reasonable and possible explanation is that the angels were sitting when the women entered the tomb, and they stood up after the women saw them. The verb "stood" in Luke might not be the current state of the angels, but rather what the angels did.</p>\n\n <p>For the argument that the earthquake, the angel coming, and the guards responding to seeing the angel occurred <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb, see the article, <a href="/answers/when-stone-rolled-away" target="_blank">When was the stone rolled away from the tomb? Did an earthquake occur?</a></p>\n\n <p>For the argument that there two angels at the tomb, see the article, <a href="/answers/how-many-angels-tomb" target="_blank">How many angels were at the tomb?</a></p>\n \n <h3>General notes</h3>\n\n <h4>The differences between the gospels point to their authenticity</h4>\n\n <p class="first">What would actually be <em>more</em> suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.</p>\n\n <p>However, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself.

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>God\'s ultimate plan is peace, but there is a spiritual war that must be fought before full peace arrives. Thus, God is both a God of peace and a God of war. There is simply no contradiction between these passages.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether God is a God of peace or a God of war. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n  \n  <h4>God is a God of peace</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Isaiah 2:4</strong> - He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; neither shall they learn war anymore.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Romans 15:33</strong> - May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>God is a God of war</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 15:3</strong> - The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Joel 3:9-10</strong> - Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate for war; stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, "I am a warrior."</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>There is simply no contradiction between these passages because God can be both a God of peace and a God of war at the same time.</p>\n  \n  <p>God, in His very nature, is a God of peace, and His ultimate plan for creation is that there will be peace. He sent His son Jesus to die for sin so that there could be reconcilation between God and man, as well as peace between humans.</p>\n  \n  <p>At the same time, God has decreed that there would be war and battles to be fought in order to achieve this peace. History is filled with both physical and spiritual war, through which God demonstrates Himself to be victorious over sin and death. At the end of this spiritual war, there will be both physical and spiritual peace.</p>\n  \n  <p>If we simply define what the terms "peace" and "war" mean within the context of the Bible and of these passages, it is clear that there is absolutely no contradiction between passages that portray God as a God of peace and passages that portray God as a God of war.</p>\n</div>',

Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n  \n  <h4>The Ishmaelites bought Joseph</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 37:28</strong> - Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 39:1</strong> - Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, had bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>The Midianites bought Joseph</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 37:36</strong> - Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>In <em>Harper\'s Bible Dictionary</em>, Achtemeier says that the term "Ishmaelite" was synonomous with the term "Midianite."[1] The two terms probably referred to the same general group that descended from Abraham.</p>\n  \n  <p>Ishmael was the son of Abraham through his handmaiden Hagar (Genesis 16), and Midian was another son of Abraham through his concubine Keturah. Both were sons of Abraham, and it is very possible that their descendents became intermingled with time.</p>\n  \n  <p>Achtemeier goes on to say this:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>The term ‘Midianite’ probably identified a confederation of tribes that roamed far beyond this ancestral homeland, a usage that explains the biblical references to Midianites in Sinai, Canaan, the Jordan Valley, Moab, and Transjordan’s eastern desert.[2]</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Thus, it is likely that the Midianites mingled with other groups, such as the Ishmaelites, such that the two terms became interchangeable.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p>The reasonable explanation that Ishmaelites and Midianites referred to the same group of people eliminates the alleged contradiction between these passages in Genesis.</p>\n</div>',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>What is the problem of evil?</h3>\n <p class="first">The "problem of evil" is this:</p>\n\n <p></p>\n <ol>\n <li>The Bible teaches that God is love and that He is all-powerful.</li>\n <li>If God is love and He is all-powerful, then evil and suffering would not exist in the world.</li>\n <li>Evil and suffering exist in the world. Therefore, the God of the Bible does not exist.</li>\n </ol>\n\n <h3>The solution to the "problem"</h3>\n <p class="first">The solution to the "problem of evil" is that #1 above does not necessary result in #2. It is true that the Bible teaches that God is love (1 John 4:8) and that God is all-powerful (Jeremiah 32:27).</p>\n \n <p>However, that God is love and that He is all-powerful does not necessarily mean that evil and suffering would not exist in the world. There is another possible conclusion, namely, that <B>God has a good purpose for the existence of evil and sufference</B>.</p>\n\n <p>What could this good purpose be? Well, the Bible teaches that evil and suffering result in both God\'s glory (in Jesus being the ultimate conquerer of evil and suffering) and greater joy for God\'s people (who experience firsthand God saving them from their own evil and granting them the joy of being a redeemed people who will spend eternity in heaven).</p>\n \n <p>Colossians 2:13-15, illustrates that sin (which includes evil and suffering) can have a good purpose because in this passage, we see God "triumphing" over sin (which exhibits God\'s glory), which produces joy in God\'s people (who have been "made alive" and "forgiven"). Without the existence of sin, evil, and suffering, these two things could not happen.</p>\n\n <h4>Colossians 2:13-15</h4>\n\n <blockquote>And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God <B>made alive</B> together with him, having <B>forgiven</B> us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by <B>triumphing</B> over them in him.</blockquote>\n\n <h3>"But those good things aren\'t worth the amount of evil and suffering that exist in the world!"</h3>\n <p class="first">The answer given above to the "problem of evil" does not neglect the fact that there is a tremendous amount of evil and suffering in the world, and that we should feel deep empathy for those who are suffering.</p>\n \n <p>However, the answer does demonstrate that the Bible is not self-contradictory regarding the "problem of evil." The idea that God\'s good purposes are not worth the amount of evil and suffering that exist in the world is a subjective opinion without any real justification.</p>\n\n <h3>To the objector: Where do you get your definition of evil?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">If one of your objections to the Bible is the "problem of evil," where do you get your definition of evil in the first place? Christians believe that God has revealed the definition of good and evil through the Bible.</p>\n \n <p>If you do not believe in God, then what is your basis for believing in good and evil in the first place? If humans are simply the product of random chance in a cold, uncaring universe where only the fittest survive, then why do you think murder, rape, and stealing are wrong?</p>\n \n <p>The answer is that you are stealing principles of morality from the Christian worldview, and that you have no moral foundation to stand on when you accuse the God of the Bible as being unjust.</p>\n </div>\n',

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>Chapter 1: Of the Holy Scriptures</h3>\n  \n  <p>1. The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and his will which is necessary unto salvation. Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church; and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God\'s revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.</p>\n<p class="first">2 Timothy 3:15-17; Isaiah 8:20; Luke 16:29, 31; Ephesians 2:20; Romans 1:19-21; Romans 2:14,15; Psalms 19:1-3; Hebrews 1:1; Proverbs 22:19-21; Romans 15:4; 2 Peter 1:19,20</p>\n\n<p>2. Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are these:</p>\n\n<p>Of the Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Solomen, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations,Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi</p>\n\n<p>Of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Paul\'s Epistle to the Romans, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, I Thessalonians, II Thessalonians, I Timothy, II Timothy, To Titus, To Philemon, The Epistle to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, The first and second Epistles of Peter, The first, second, and third Epistles of John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation</p>\n\n<p>All of which are given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.</p>\n<p class="first">2 Timothy 3:16)</p>\n\n<p>3. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.</p>\n<p class="first">Luke 24:27, 44; Romans 3:2</p>\n\n<p>4. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it is the Word of God.</p>\n<p class="first">2 Peter 1:19-21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9</p>\n\n<p>5. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man\'s salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.</p>\n<p class="first">John 16:13,14; 1 Corinthians 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20, 27)</p>\n\n<p>6. The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man\'s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or traditions of men. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word, and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.</p>\n<p class="first">2 Timothy 3:15-17; Galatians 1:8,9; John 6:45; 1 Corinthians 2:9-12; 1 Corinthians 11:13, 14; 1 Corinthians 14:26,40)</p>\n\n<p>7. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all; yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient understanding of them.</p>\n<p class="first">2 Peter 3:16; Psalms 19:7; Psalms 119:130)</p>\n\n<p>8. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.</p>\n<p class="first">Romans 3:2; Isaiah 8:20; Acts 15:15; John 5:39; 1 Corinthians 14:6, 9, 11, 12, 24, 28; Colossians 3:16</p>\n\n<p>9. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched by other places that speak more clearly.</p>\n<p class="first">2 Peter 1:20, 21; Acts 15:15, 16)</p>\n\n<p>10. The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally resolved.</p>\n<p class="first">Matthew 22:29, 31, 32; Ephesians 2:20; Acts 28:23)</p>\n</div>',

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>The two passages are completely different contexts. 1 Corinthians 14:33 is referring to God not being the author of confusion in terms of order within the church, and Genesis 11:7-9 is about God creating confusion as judgment for the people\'s pride and sin. The phrase "author of confusion" in 1 Corinthians 14:33 is restricted to a particular context that does not apply to Genesis 11:7-9.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether God is the author of confusion. 1 Corinthians 14:33 says that God is not the author of confusion, while Genesis 11:7-9 and the incident at the Tower of Babel seem to convey that God is the author of confusion. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n  \n  <h4>God is not the author of confusion</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>1 Corinthians 14:33</strong> - For God is not a God of confusion but of peace...</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>God creates confusion at the Tower of Babel</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 11:7-9</strong> - "Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another\'s speech." So the Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth. And from there the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <h4>The contexts are completely different</h4>\n  \n  <p>There is no contradiction between these two passages because the contects of the two passages are completely different. 1 Corinthians 14:33 is speaking about order within the church, and Genesis 11:7-9 is speaking about how God punished people at the Tower of Babel for their pride and sin.</p>\n  \n  <h4>1 Corinthians 14:33 is speaking about church order</h4>\n  \n  <p>Let\'s take a look at the context of 1 Corinthians 14:33, verses 26-33:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>26 What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. 27 If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. 28 But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. 30 If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. 31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged, 32 and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. 33 For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. (1 Corinthians 14:26-33)</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>As we can see, in this passage, Paul is addressing order within the church. People in the Corinthian church were speaking in tongues without an interpreter, which created confusion in the church service.</p>\n  \n  <p>When Paul says that "God is not a God of confusion but of peace," he is saying that God did not intend for the church service to be a place of confusion and chaos, but rather that it should be a place of orderly worship.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Genesis 11:7-9 is speaking about God punishing sin</h4>\n  \n  <p>When God confuses the people\'s languages in Genesis 11:7-9, He is punishing the people for their pride and sin. This is a not a contradiction of 1 Corinthians 14:33 because God is not creating confusion within a church service here.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p>For this issue concerning whether God is an author of confusion or not, context is key. There is no contradiction because 1 Corinthians 14:33 and Genesis 11:7-9 speak about very different contexts that do not apply to the other.</p>\n</div',

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>People who were described as "righteous" or "blameless" in the Bible, such as Job, Noah, Zacharias, and Elizabeth, were still sinners who needed to be saved by Jesus\' atoning work. They were believers who trusted in the coming messiah for their salvation, and who were faithful in obeying God\'s commandments.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether any human is righteous, or whether all humans have sinned. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n  \n  <h4>All have sinned</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Romans 3:23</strong> - for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Romans 3:10</strong> - None is righteous, no, not one</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Psalm 14:3</strong> - They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>Some are righteous or blameless</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Job 1:1</strong> - There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 7:1</strong> - Then the Lord said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Luke 1:6</strong> - And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>There is no contradiction between the two sets of passages because they are referring to two different concepts.</p>\n  \n  <p>Romans 3:9-10, Romans 3:23, and Psalm 14:3 are referring to the fact that every human is guilty of sin and therefore in need of a savior, whereas Job 1:1, Genesis 7:1, and Luke 1:5-6 are referring to the <strong>current state</strong> of Job, Noah, Zacharias, and Elizabeth. The second set of verses do not say that these people <strong>never</strong> sinned or that they do not need a savior.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, Job, Noah, Zacharias, and Elizabeth were still people who were guilty of sin and in need of a savior. They were believers who trusted in the coming messiah (Jesus) for their salvation, and who were walking faithfully in obedience to God\'s commands. Because of their faith and the kind of life they were living <strong>currently</strong>, God viewed them as being righteous and blameless.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p>There is absolutely no contradiction between these two sets of verses. The first set of verses talk about nobody being righteous in terms of being able to save themselves, and the second set of verses talk about some believers who are viewed as righteous by God because of their faith and obedience.</p>\n</div',

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>No. When it appears that God is changing His mind in the Bible, the Bible is utilizing anthropomorphism, or the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. This is done to help explain God in language we can more easily understand.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether God changes His mind. Malachi 3:6 says that God does not change, but Genesis 6:6-7, Exodus 32:14, and Jonah 3:10 appear to say that God changes His mind. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n  \n  <h4>God does not change</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Malachi 3:6</strong> - For I the Lord do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>God changes His mind</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 6:6-7</strong> - And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the Lord said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them."</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 32:14</strong> - And the Lord relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Jonah 3:10</strong> - When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <h4>God appearing to change His mind in the Bible is an example of anthropomorphism</h4>\n  \n  <p>When it appears that God is changing His mind in the Bible, the Bible is utilizing anthropomorphism, or the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. This is done to help explain God in language we can more easily understand.</p>\n  \n  <h4>God had always planned to do what He ended up doing</h4>\n  \n  <p>The Bible clearly teaches that God always accomplishes what He desires:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose. (Isaiah 46:10b)</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>This means that it would be contradictory for God to be "sorry" or "regret" that He had done something.</p>\n  \n  <p>The concept of anthropomorphism helps explain why the Bible uses this kind of language to sometimes describe God.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, what is actually happening is that God had always planned for this exact sequence of events to happen in this order. It was always part of God\'s plan to punish humans for their increasing sin (Genesis 6:6-7) and to forgive the Israelites and Ninevites when they repented (Exodus 32:14, Jonah 3:10).</p>\n</div>',

Believers will not experience the fullness of heaven until Jesus returns and they receive a resurrected body.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether anyone has ascended into heaven before Jesus. Here are the relevant verses:</p>\n  \n  <h4>Enoch and Elijah ascended to heaven</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 5:24</strong> - Enoch walked with God, and he was not,[a] for God took him.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>2 Kings 2:11</strong> - And as they still went on and talked, behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Hebrews 11:5</strong> - By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>Only Jesus has ascended to heaven</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>John 3:13</strong> - No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>The sense in which Enoch and Elijah ascended into heaven is different from the sense in which Jesus ascended into heaven.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Believers right now enter into heaven in a certain sense</h4>\n  \n  <p>Currently, when believers die, and when Enoch and Elijah ascended into heaven, they enter into heaven in a particular sense. The doctrine of soul sleep, or that after death believers exist in a state of unconsciousness until Jesus returns, is unbiblical.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jesus said to the thief on the cross, "Truly, I say to you, <strong>today</strong> you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43). This shows that even now, believers are with God in heaven, in a certain sense.</p>\n  \n  <p>Enoch and Elijah are simply unique in that they did not need to die to enter into heaven, but they are almost certainly in the exact same place as other believers who have died.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Jesus ascended into the fullness of heaven, which believers will not experience until Jesus returns</h4>\n  \n  <p>The heaven that Jesus descended from and will ascend to is the fullness of heaven, and believers will not experience this kind of heaven until Jesus returns.</p>\n  \n  <p>In Philippians 3:20-21, Paul says this about what will happen when Jesus returns, or the kind of heaven that believers are <strong>waiting</strong> for:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>So, we see that although believers enter into heaven in a certain sense even now, there is another sense of heaven that believers will not enter into until Jesus returns. We are "awaiting" for Jesus to return, and when that happens, Jesus will "transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body." When that happens, we will experience the fullness of heaven, as Jesus does.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a concept called the <strong>already</strong> and the <strong>not yet</strong>. The heaven that believers experience today is what we <strong>already have</strong>, but there is another sense of heaven that believers can <strong>not yet</strong> experience.</p>\n</div>',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>What is the Chalcedonian Creed?</h3>\n \n <p class="first">The Chalcedonian Creed, also known as the Chalcedonian Definition, was adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in A.D. 451. The creed addresses the deity of Christ and states that Jesus possesses two natures and exists in one person.</p>\n \n <p>The Chalcedonian Creed was the result of controversy between the Western and Eastern churches concerning what occurred in the incarnation. The Western churches affirmed that the incarnation resulted in Jesus possessing two natures, whereas the Eastern churches, holding to Cyril of Alexandria\'s view, believed that Jesus only possesses one nature.</p>\n \n <h3>The Chalcedonian Creed</h3>\n <p class="first">\n We, then, following the holy Fathers, all with one consent, teach men to\n confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in\n Godhead and also perfect in manhood; truly God and truly man, of a\n reasonable [rational] soul and body; consubstantial [co-essential] with\n the Father according to the Godhead, and consubstantial with us according\n to the Manhood; in all things like unto us, without sin; begotten before\n all ages of the Father according to the Godhead, and in these latter days,\n for us and for our salvation, born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God,\n according to the Manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only\n begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably,\n indivisibly, inseparably; the distinction of natures being by no means\n taken away by the unity, but rather the property of each nature being\n preserved, and concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not parted or\n divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten, God\n the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ; as the prophets from the beginning [have\n declared] concerning him, and the Lord Jesus Christ himself has taught us,\n and the Creed of the holy Fathers has handed down to us.\n </p>\n </div>\n',

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n\n  <p class="first">Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether there are one or three Gods. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n\n  <h4>There is only one God</h4>\n\n  <blockquote class="first"><strong>Deuteronomy 6:4</strong> - Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</blockquote>\n\n  <blockquote><strong>Isaiah 43:10b</strong> - ...Before me no god was formed,\n    nor shall there be any after me.</blockquote>\n\n  <blockquote><strong>Isaiah 44:6</strong> - ... besides me there is no god</blockquote>\n\n  <blockquote><strong>Isaiah 44:8</strong> - ... Is there a God besides me? There is no Rock; I know not any.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>There are many Gods</h4>\n  \n  <blockquote class="first"><strong>Genesis 1:26</strong> - Then God said, "Let <strong>us</strong> make man in <strong>our</strong> image, after <strong>our</strong> likeness..."</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesis 3:22</strong> - Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of <strong>us</strong> in knowing good and evil..."</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Genesus 11:7</strong> - Come, let <strong>us</strong> go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another\'s speech.</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>1 Corinthians 8:5</strong> - For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth&mdash;as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"...</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>1 John 5:8</strong> - the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <h4 class="first">There is only one God</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">Foundationally, there is only one God, as Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 43:10, Isaiah 44:6, and Isaiah 44:8 state.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Other "gods" are false gods that do not truly exist</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">When the Bible speaks of other "gods," it is speaking of false gods that do not exist, as demonstrated by the following passages:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. (Galatians 4:8)</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote>...and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men\'s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. (Isaiah 37:19)</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote>Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? (Jeremiah 2:11a)</blockquote>\n  \n  <h4>Possibilities concerning the Genesis passages</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">In Genesis, when it refers to God using the words, "us" and "our," there are two reasonable possibilities that do not contradict the doctrine that there is only one God.</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n    <li>The plural pronouns could point towards the doctrine of the Trinity, which states that the one God exists in three "persons," or that God is one in <strong>substance</strong> and three in <strong>person</strong>, which is not a contradiction. There is a distinction between "substance" and "person."</li>\n    <li>The plural pronouns could be a "royal we." Sometimes, the pronoun "we" is used to refer to a king or monarch.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h4>God is one in substance and three in person</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">1 John 5:8 points towards the doctrine of the Trinity, which teaches that the one Godhead exists in three persons. In other words, there is a sense in which God is one, and there is another sense in which God is three.</p>\n  \n  <p>God is one in the sense that He is one in <strong>substance</strong>. God is three in the sense that He exists in three "persons": 1) the Father, 2) the Son, and 3) the Holy Spirit.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct in that each one is the "terminating front-person" for the various acts of God. In other words, while the entire Godhead performs all the actions of God (since God is one), the different things that God does is generally "attributed" to one of the persons of God. This is what we mean when we say that a particular person of God is the "terminating front-person" for a particular action of God.</p>\n</div>',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>What are the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion?</h3>\n \n <p class="first">The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion define the doctrines and practices of the Church of England regarding the controversies of the English Reformation. They were finalized in 1571. These articles were written when Calvinist doctrine reached its greatest influence in the Church of England.</p>\n \n <h3>The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion</h3>\n <p class="first">\n <strong>THE ARTICLES OF RELIGION</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Agreed upon by the Archbishops, Bishops, and the whole clergy of the\n Provinces of Canterbury and York, London, 1562.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or\n passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and\n Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this\n Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the\n Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>II. Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the\n Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father,\n took Man\'s nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so\n that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and\n Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof\n is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, war crucified,\n dead and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not\n only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>III. Of the going down of Christ into Hell</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n As Christ died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed, that\n he went down into Hell.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>IV. Of the Resurrection of Christ</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with\n flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man\'s\n nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he\n return to judge all Men at the last day.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>V. Of the Holy Ghost</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one\n substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and\n eternal God.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>VI. Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for salvation</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that\n whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be\n required of any man, that it should be. believed as an article of the\n Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of\n the Holy Scripture we do understand those Canonical Books of the Old and\n New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong><em>Of the Names and Numbers of the Canonical Books</em></strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">Genesis</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Exodus</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Leviticus</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Numbers</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Deuteronomy</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Joshua</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Judges</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Ruth</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The First Book of Samuel</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Second Book of Samuel</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The First Book of Kings</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Second Book of Kings</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The First Book of Chronicles</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Second Book of Chronicles</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The First Book of Esdras</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Second Book of Esdras</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Book of Esther</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Book of Job</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Psalms</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Proverbs</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Ecclesiastes or Preacher</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Cantica or Songs of Solomon</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Four Prophets the greater</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Twelve Prophets the less</p>\n <p>\n <strong><em>\n And the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example\n of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to\n establish any doctrine; such are these following:\n </em></strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">The Third Book of Kings</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Fourth Book of Kings</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Book of Tobias</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Book of Judith</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The rest of the Book of Esther</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Book of Wisdom</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Jesus the Son of Sirach</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Baruch the Prophet</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Song of the Three Children</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Story of Susanna</p>\n <p class="nomargin">Of Bel and the Dragon</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Prayer of Manasses</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The First Book of Maccabees</p>\n <p class="nomargin">The Second Book of Maccabees</p>\n <p>\n All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do\n receive, and account them Canonical.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>VII. Of the Old Testament</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New\n Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the\n only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they\n are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for\n transitory promises. Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching\n Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts\n thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet\n notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of\n the Commandments which are called Moral.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>VIII. Of the Three Creeds</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius\'s Creed, and that which is\n commonly called the Apostles\' Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and\n believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy\n Scripture.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>IX. Of Original or Birth-sin</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Original Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do\n vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the mature of every\n man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is\n very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature\n inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit;\n and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God\'s\n wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature Both remain, yea in them\n that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek,\n phronema sarkos, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some\n the affection some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of\n God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are\n baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath\n of itself the nature of sin.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>X. Of Free Will</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such that he cannot turn\n and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith,\n and calling upon God: Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant\n and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us,\n that we may have a ,good will, and working with us, when we have that good\n will.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XI. Of the justification of Adam</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and\n Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings:\n Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only is a most wholesome\n Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the\n Homily of Justification.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XII. Of Good Works</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after\n Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God\'s\n judgement; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do\n spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; insomuch that by them a\n lively, Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XIII. Of Works before Justification</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit,\n are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus\n Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the\n School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that they\n are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt\n not but they have the nature of sin.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XIV. Of Works of Supererogation</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God\'s Commandments, which they\n call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogant\' and\n impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God\n as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake, than\n of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have\n done all that arc commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XV. Of Christ alone without Sin</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin\n only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his\n spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself\n once made, should take away the sins of the world, and sin, as Saint ,John\n saith, was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized, and born\n again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin,\n we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XVI. Of Sin after Baptism</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the\n Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to\n be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received\n the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by\n the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives. And therefore\n they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they\n live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XVII. Of Predestination and Election</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before\n the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his\n counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he\n hath chosen in Christ out of mankind. and to bring them by Christ to\n everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which be\n endued with so excellent a benefit of God be called according to God\'s\n purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the\n calling: they be justified freely: then be made sons of God by adoption:\n they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son ,Jesus Christ: they\n walk religiously in good works, and at length, by God\'s mercy, they attain\n to everlasting felicity.\n </p>\n <p>\n As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ,\n is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and\n such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying\n the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their\n mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly\n establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed\n through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards\n God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to\n have continually before their eyes the sentence of God\'s Predestination,\n is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either\n into desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less\n perilous than desperation.\n </p>\n <p>\n Furthermore, we must receive God\'s promises in such wise, as they be\n generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will\n of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the\n Word of God.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XVIII. Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall\n be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to\n frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature. For Holy\n Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men\n must be saved.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XIX. Of the Church</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in the\n which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be\n dulyministered according to Christ\'s ordinance in all those things that of\n necessity are requisite to the same.\n </p>\n <p>\n As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also\n the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of\n Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XX. Of the Authority of the Church</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authorityin\n Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain\n any thing that is contrary to God\'s Word written, neither may it so\n expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.\n Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ, as\n it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same\n ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of\n Salvation.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXI. Of the Authority of General Councils</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n General Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and\n will of Princes. And when they be gathered together, (forasmuch as they be\n an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word\n of God,) they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining\n unto God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have\n neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be\n taken out of Holy Scripture.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXII. Of Purgatory</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and\n Adoration, as well of Images as of Reliques, and also invocation of\n Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of\n Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXIII. Of Ministering in the Congregation</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of publick\n preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be\n lawfully called, and sent to execute the same. And those we ought to judge\n lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men\n who have publick authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call\n and send Ministers into the Lord\'s vineyard.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>\n XXIV. Of speaking in the Congregation in such a tongue as the people\n understandeth\n </strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the\n Primitive Church, to have publick Prayer in the Church, or to minister the\n Sacraments in a tongue not understanded of the people.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXV. Of the Sacraments</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian\n men\'s profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual\n signs of grace, and God\'s good will towards us, by the which he doth work\n invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and\n confirm our Faith in him.\n </p>\n <p>\n There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that\n is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.\n </p>\n <p>\n Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,\n Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for\n Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt\n following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the\n Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and\n the Lord\'s Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony\n ordained of God.\n </p>\n <p>\n The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be\n carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as\n worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect or operation: but\n they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation, as\n Saint Paul saith.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>\n XXVI. Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect\n of the Sacrament\n </strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and\n sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word\n and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name,\n but in Christ\'s, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may\n use their ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving of\n the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ\'s ordinance taken away by\n their wickedness, nor the grace of God\'s gifts diminished from such as by\n faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be\n effectual, because of Christ\'s institution and promise, although they be\n ministered by evil then.\n </p>\n <p>\n Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that\n inquire be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that\n have knowledge of their offences; and finally being found guilty, by just\n judgement be deposed.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXVII. Of Baptism</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby\n Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened, but it is\n also a sign of Regeneration or new Birth, whereby, as by an instrument,\n they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the\n promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be sons of God by\n the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and\n Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The Baptism of young\n Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable\n with the institution of Christ.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXVIII. Of the Lord\'s Supper</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians\n ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather is a Sacrament\n of our Redemption by Christ\'s death: insomuch that to such as rightly,\n worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a\n partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a\n partaking of the Blood of Christ.\n </p>\n <p>\n Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in\n the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to\n the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and\n hath given occasion to many superstitions.\n </p>\n <p>\n The Body of Christ is given, taken and eaten in the Supper, only after an\n heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is\n received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.\n </p>\n <p>\n The Sacrament of the Lord\'s Supper was not by Christ\'s ordinance reserved,\n carried about, lifted up or worshipped.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>\n XXIX. Of the Wicked which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of the\n Lord\'s Supper\n </strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Wicked. and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do\n carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the\n Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they\n partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do cat and drink\n the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXX. Of both kinds</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the\n parts of the Lord\'s Sacrament, by Christ\'s ordinance and commandment,\n ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXI. Of the Oblation of Christ of Christ finished upon the Cross</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation,\n and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and\n actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone.\n Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said,\n that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have\n remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous\n deceits.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n Bishops, Priests and Deacons are not commanded by God\'s Law, either to vow\n the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is\n lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to mary at their own\n discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXIII. Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n That person whcih by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off\n from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the\n whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be\n openly reconciled by penance and received into the Church by a Judge that\n hath authority thereunto.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one,\n and utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be\n changed according to the diversities of countries, times, and men\'s\n manners, so that nothing be ordained against God\'s Word. Whosoever through\n his private judgement, willingly and purposely, cloth openly break the\n traditions and ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the\n Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be\n rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that\n offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the\n authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak\n brethren.\n </p>\n <p>\n Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and\n abolish, ceremonies or rites of the Church ordained only by man\'s\n authority, so that all things be done to edifying.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXV. Of the Homilies</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined\n under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and\n necessary for these tunes, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which were\n set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge them to\n be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they\n may be understanded of the people.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong><em>Of the Names of the Homilies</em></strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">1. Of the right Use of the Church</p>\n <p class="nomargin">2. Against peril of Idolatry </p>\n <p class="nomargin">3. Of repairing and keeping clean of Churches</p>\n <p class="nomargin">4. Of good Works: first of Fasting</p>\n <p class="nomargin">5. Against Gluttony and Drunkenness </p>\n <p class="nomargin">6. Against Excess of Apparel </p>\n <p class="nomargin">7. Of Prayer</p>\n <p class="nomargin">8. Of the Place and Time of Prayer</p>\n <p class="nomargin">\n 9. That Common Prayer and Sacraments ought to be ministered in a known\n tongue\n </p>\n <p class="nomargin">10. Of the reverend estimation of God\'s Word</p>\n <p class="nomargin">11. Of Alms-doing</p>\n <p class="nomargin">12. Of the Nativity of Christ</p>\n <p class="nomargin">13. Of the Passion of Christ</p>\n <p class="nomargin">14. Of the Resurrection of Christ</p>\n <p class="nomargin">\n 15. Of the worthy receiving of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of\n Christ\n </p>\n <p class="nomargin">16. Of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost</p>\n <p class="nomargin">17. For the Rogation of Days </p>\n <p class="nomargin">18. Of the State of Matrimony</p>\n <p class="nomargin">19. Of Repentance</p>\n <p class="nomargin">20. Against Idleness </p>\n <p class="nomargin">21. Against Rebellion</p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXVI. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Book of Consecration of :archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering of\n Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the tine of Edward the Sixth, and\n confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, Both contain all\n things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering: neither bath it any\n thing, that of itself is superstitious and ungodly. And therefore\n whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that Book,\n since the second year of the forenamed King Edward unto this time, or\n hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same Rites; we\n decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and\n ordered.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXVII. Of the Civil Magistrates</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The King\'s Majesty bath the chief power in this Realm of England, and\n other his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this\n Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes cloth\n appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign\n jurisdiction.\n </p>\n <p>\n Where we attribute to the King\'s Majesty the chief government, by which\n Titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended; we\n give not to our Princes the ministering either of God\'s Word, or of the\n Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by\n Elizabeth our Queen do most plainly testify; but that only prerogative,\n which we see to have been given always to all godly Princes in Holy\n Scriptures by God himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and\n degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical\n or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evildoers.\n </p>\n <p>The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.</p>\n <p>\n The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and\n grievous offences.\n </p>\n <p>\n It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to\n wear weapons, and serve in the wars.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXVIII. Of Christian men\'s Goods, which are not common</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n The Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right,\n title, and possession of the same, as certain Anabaptists do falsely\n boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth,\n liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.\n </p>\n <p>\n <strong>XXXIX. Of a Christian man\'s oath</strong>\n </p>\n <p class="first">\n As we confess that vain and rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by\n our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle, so we judge, that Christian\n Religion cloth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate\n requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the\n Prophet\'s teaching, injustice, judgement, and truth.\n </p>\n </div>\n',

Luke 24:10 says that "Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women" were at the tomb, which is at least five women. The other gospels do not say that <em>only</em> the two Marys, <em>only</em> the two Marys and Salome, or <em>only</em> Mary Magdalene went to the tomb, so there is no contradiction. In fact, in John, Mary Magdalene says to Peter and John, "...<strong>we</strong> do not know where they have laid him..." It is reasonable to believe that the other authors simply didn\'t list out all the women who went to the tomb, for various reasons.\n </p>\n\n <h3>2. Before the women arrived at the tomb, there was an earthquake and an angel rolled away the stone</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Matthew 28:1-10 | v2-4</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">2</span> And behold, <a href="#earthquake" id="earthquake-s"><span class="teal">there was a great earthquake</span></a>, for <a href="#how-many-angels"><span class="orange"></a>an angel</span> of the Lord descended from heaven and came and <a href="#stone-rolled-away" id="stone-rolled-away-s"><span class="blue">rolled back the stone</span></a> and <a href="#standing-sitting" id="standing-sitting-s"><span class="indigo">sat</span></a> <a href="#where-angels" id="where-angels-s"><span class="pink">on it</span></a>. <span class="scripture-verse">3</span> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. <span class="scripture-verse">4</span> And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h4 class="teal">\n <a href="#earthquake-s" id="earthquake">\n <span class="teal">Why is the earthquake only recorded in Matthew?</span>\n </a>\n </h4>\n\n <p class="first">The earthquake occurred <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb. Matthew\'s account helps explain how the stone was rolled away and why there were no guards. The other authors simply leave out these additional details.</p>\n\n <h3>3. The women arrived at the tomb and saw that the stoned was rolled away</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Mark 16:1-8 | v3-4</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">3</span> And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?" <span class="scripture-verse">4</span> And looking up, <a href="#stone-rolled-away"><span class="blue">they saw that the stone had been rolled back</span></a>&mdash;it was very large.\n </p>\n </div>\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v2</p> \n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">2</span> And <a href="#stone-rolled-away"><span class="blue">they found the stone rolled away from the tomb</span></a>,\n </p>\n </div>\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">John 20:1-29 | v1b</p> \n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">1b</span> and <a href="#stone-rolled-away"><span class="blue">saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb</span></a>.\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h4>\n <a href="#stone-rolled-away-s" id="stone-rolled-away">\n <span class="blue">Was the stone rolled away before or after the women arrived at the tomb?</span>\n </a>\n </h4>\n\n <p class="first">As explained above, the stone was rolled away before the women arrived at the tomb. The events of <span class="scripture">Matthew 28:2-4</span> occurred <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb.</p>\n\n <h3>4. Upon seeing the stone rolled away, Mary Magdalene separated from the other women to go tell Peter and John, who were not staying at Bethany with the other disciples</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">John 20:1-29 | v2</p> \n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">2</span> So she ran and <a href="#peter-john" id="peter-john-s"><span class="orange-1">went to Simon Peter and the other disciple</span></a>, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and <a href="#how-many-women"><span class="red">we</span></a> do not know where they have laid him."\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h4><a href="#peter-john-s" id="peter-john"><span class="orange-1">Were Peter and John with the other disciples?</span></a></h4>\n\n <p class="first">Peter and John were likely not staying with the other disciples. We know that although all the disciples fled, Peter and John were brave enough to follow Jesus into Jerusalem (<span class="scripture">John 18:15</span>). John was also present at the cross (<span class="scripture">John 19:26</span>). It is likely that Peter and John met up at some point and stayed in Jerusalem, while the rest of the disciples were staying in Bethany.</p>\n\n <h3>5.

Did the women see angels or men?</span></a></h4>\n\n <p class="first">The women saw two angels at the tomb. Matthew does not say that there was <em>only</em> one angel, and Mark does not say that there was <em>only</em> one man. Perhaps they simply felt that they did not need to emphasize that there were two angels, or two men.</p>\n\n <p>Regarding whether the women saw angels or men, angels oftentime appeared in the form of men (<span class="scripture">Genesis 18:1–2</span>; <span class="scripture">Daniel 9:21</span>. So, it is reasonable to believe that the women saw angels who looked like men.</p>\n\n <h4><a href="#where-angels-s" id="where-angels"><span class="pink">Were the angels inside the tomb or sitting on the stone?</span></a></h4>\n\n <p class="first">As explained above, the events of <span class="scripture">Matthew 28:2-4</span> occurred <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb. The angel in Matthew was on top of the stone when the guards saw him and fainted/fled, and then actually met the women inside the tomb. Mark, Luke, and John all record the angels meeting the women inside the tomb using slightly different, but not contradictory, language.</p>\n\n <h4><a href="#standing-sitting-s" id="standing-sitting"><span class="indigo">Were the angels standing or sitting when the women met them?</span></a></h4>\n\n <p class="first">The angels were probably sitting when the women saw them, and then they stood up immediately afterwards. When Luke says that the angels "stood" (<span class="scripture">Luke 24:4</span>), he could be referred to an action that they did at that moment, rather than what they had already done.</p>\n\n <h3>6. The women (except Mary Magdalene) left the tomb to go tell the disciples (except Peter and John), who were in Bethany, about the empty tomb</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Matthew 28:1-10 | v8</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">8</span> So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran <a href="#who-women-tell" id="who-women-tell-s"><span class="cyan">to tell his disciples</span></a>.\n </p>\n </div>\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Mark 16:1-8 | v8</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">8</span> And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and <a href="#who-women-tell"><span class="cyan">they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid</span></a>.\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h4><a href="#who-women-tell-s" id="who-women-tell"><span class="cyan">Did the women (except Mary Magdalene) tell the disciples about the empty tomb?</span></a></h4>\n\n <p class="first">It is reasonable to believe that at first the women didn\'t say anything to anyone because they were afraid, and then after they overcame this fear, they remembered the angels\' words and told the disciples. <span class="scripture">Luke 24:8</span> says specifically that the women "remembered his words," which could imply that they at first told nobody, but decided to tell the disciples after they remembered what the angels had said to them.</p>\n\n <p>We know that Thomas was not with the other disciples at first (<span class="scripture">John 20:24</span>), so he was told about the events later.</p>\n\n <h3>7. Peter, John, and Mary Magdalene arrive at the tomb. Peter and John return home.</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Matthew 28:1-10 | v8</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">3</span> So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. <span class="scripture-verse">4</span> Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. <span class="scripture-verse">5</span> And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. <span class="scripture-verse">6</span> Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, <span class="scripture-verse">7</span> and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus\' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. <span class="scripture-verse">8</span> Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; <span class="scripture-verse">9</span> for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <span class="scripture-verse">10</span> Then the disciples went back to their homes.\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h3>8. Jesus appears first to Mary Magdalene while she is at the tomb, then to the other women while they are on their way to Bethany to tell the disciples, or vice versa</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Matthew 28:1-10 | v9-10</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">9</span> And behold, <a href="#jesus-appearance" id="jesus-appearance-s"><span class="green">Jesus met them</span></a> and said, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. <span class="scripture-verse">10</span> Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."\n </p>\n </div>\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">John 24:1-29 | v11-18</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">11</span> But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. <span class="scripture-verse">12</span> And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. <span class="scripture-verse">13</span> They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him." <span class="scripture-verse">14</span> Having said this, <a href="#jesus-appearance"><span class="green">she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus</span></a>. <span class="scripture-verse">15</span> Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away." <span class="scripture-verse">16</span> Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher). <span class="scripture-verse">17</span> Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’" <span class="scripture-verse">18</span> Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord"—and that he had said these things to her.\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h4><a href="#jesus-appearance-s" id="jesus-appearance"><span class="green">Did Jesus appear first to a group of women, or to Mary Magdalene alone?</span></a></h4>\n\n <p class="first">Jesus either appeared first to Mary Magdalene at the tomb, and then to the group of women while they were on their way to Bethany to tell the disciples, or vice versa. It is reasonable to believe that Mark and Luke do not mention either of these appearances because they\'ve already included spectacular events that have happened this day, and their specific narrative of events did not require mentioning these appearances.</p>\n\n <h3>9. The other women (except Mary Magdalene) tell the other disciples in Bethany about the empty tomb</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v8-12</p> \n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">8</span> And they remembered his words, <span class="scripture-verse">9</span> and returning from the tomb <a href="#who-women-tell"><span class="cyan">they told all these things</span></a> <a href="#who-tell" id="who-tell-s"><span class="brown">to the eleven and to all the rest</span></a>. <span class="scripture-verse">10</span> <a href="#who-tell"><span class="brown">Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles</span></a>, <span class="scripture-verse">11</span> but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. <span class="scripture-verse">12</span> But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h4><a href="#who-tell-s" id="who-tell"><span class="brown">Were all the women and all the disciples together when the news about the empty tomb was told?</span></a></h4>\n\n <p class="first">Probably not. It is likely that Mary Magdalene had separated from the rest of the women to tell Peter and John, who were staying at a different place than the rest of the disciples. The rest of the women (except Mary Magdalene) told the rest of the disciples, and they may have either made an extra stop, or split up, to tell Cleopas and an unnamed disciple about the day\'s events also (<span class="scripture">Luke 24:13-24</span>)</p>\n\n <h3>10. Jesus\' third appearance was to Cleopas and his companion</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v13-32</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">13</span> That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, <span class="scripture-verse">14</span> and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. <span class="scripture-verse">15</span> While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. <span class="scripture-verse">16</span> But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <span class="scripture-verse">17</span> And he said to them, "What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?" And they stood still, looking sad. <span class="scripture-verse">18</span> Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?" <span class="scripture-verse">19</span> And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <span class="scripture-verse">20</span> and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <span class="scripture-verse">21</span> But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <span class="scripture-verse">22</span> Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, <span class="scripture-verse">23</span> and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <span class="scripture-verse">24</span> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see." <span class="scripture-verse">25</span> And he said to them, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! <span class="scripture-verse">26</span> Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?" <span class="scripture-verse">27</span> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.\n\n <span class="scripture-verse">28</span> So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, <span class="scripture-verse">29</span> but they urged him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them. <span class="scripture-verse">30</span> When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. <span class="scripture-verse">31</span> And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. <span class="scripture-verse">32</span> They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h3>11. Jesus\' fourth appearance was to Peter</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v33-35</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">33</span> And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, <span class="scripture-verse">34</span> saying, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!" <span class="scripture-verse">35</span> Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h3>12. Jesus\' fifth appearance was to many disciples, including the eleven</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v36-44</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">36</span> As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace to you!” <span class="scripture-verse">37</span> But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. <span class="scripture-verse">38</span> And he said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? <span class="scripture-verse">39</span> See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have." <span class="scripture-verse">40</span> And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. <span class="scripture-verse">41</span> And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?" <span class="scripture-verse">42</span> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <span class="scripture-verse">43</span> and he took it and ate before them.\n\n <span class="scripture-verse">44</span> Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."\n </p>\n </div>\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">John 20:1-29 | v19-23</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">19</span> On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." <span class="scripture-verse">20</span> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. <span class="scripture-verse">21</span> Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you." <span class="scripture-verse">22</span> And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. <span class="scripture-verse">23</span> If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld."\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n\n <h3>13. Jesus appears to Thomas</h3>\n\n <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">\n <div class="resurrection-scripture">\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">John 20:1-29 | v24-29</p>\n <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">\n <span class="scripture-verse">24</span> Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin,[d] was not with them when Jesus came. <span class="scripture-verse">25</span> So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe."\n\n <span class="scripture-verse">26</span> Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you." <span class="scripture-verse">27</span> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe." <span class="scripture-verse">28</span> Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!" <span class="scripture-verse">29</span> Jesus said to him, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."\n </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n <h3>General notes concerning harmonizing the resurrection accounts</h3>\n\n <h4>The differences between the gospels point to their authenticity</h4>\n\n <p class="first">What would actually be <em>more</em> suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.</p>\n\n <p>However, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself. So, rather than producing doubt, the differences between the gospel accounts should actually make us more confident in the historicity of the resurrection accounts.</p>\n \n <h4>It is perfectly normal for eyewitness accounts to differ</h4>\n \n <p class="first">Not every witness to an event recalls all of the details perfectly, or in the exact same way, so we should expect various accounts of the resurrection events to differ from one another.</p>\n \n <h4>The key is that there are no irreconcilable contradictions</h4>\n \n <p class="first">As long as we can provide <strong>possibilities</strong> for how the various resurrection accounts could reconcile into one coherent narrative, then there would be no irreconcilable, or necessary contradiction. This would then allow us to continue believing in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible without any compromise.</p>\n \n <h4>"But, I\'m not convinced by your explanations. I still think these are irreconcilable contradictions."</h4>\n \n <p class="first">It\'s likely that non-believers won\'t accept the possible explanations that we provide concerning reconciling the apparent contradictions in the resurrection narratives. However, their refusal to accept these explanations is not based upon the fact that reasonable and possible explanations have been provided, but simply upon the fact that they don\'t <strong>want</strong> to believe that there are legitimately reasonable and possible explanations.</p>\n \n <p>Their goal is simply to continue justifying their unbelief in the Bible, regardless of any fact or explanation provided to them. So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do. We should inform them that they are being unreasonable and stubborn, and that they are simply trying to shut their minds to the truth.</p>\n</div>',

We believe that baptism is "necessary" for salvation in that baptism is commanded by God, and thus one who refuses baptism demonstrates a lack of true saving faith. A better question to use for framing this debate is, "At what point is a person saved: upon having faith, or upon being baptized?"</p>\n\n <h4>The key issue</h4>\n\n <p class="first">The key issue is not these individual passages, but rather, answering the question, "Does the Bible teach that salvation is through faith alone?" If the answer to that question is "Yes," then the question is, "What exactly does it mean to be saved through faith alone?"</p>\n\n <p>The value in debating these individual passages is simply to demonstrate that they do not contradict the doctrine of salvation through faith alone. However, we do not build our theology of salvation upon these individual passages. They are peripheral to the key issue, which is the doctrine of salvation through faith alone.</p>\n\n <h3>Responding to Galatians 3:27</h3>\n\n <h4>Paul\'s entire argument in Galatians is that we are justified by faith alone</h4>\n\n <p class="first">In Galatians 2:16, Paul says this:</p>\n\n <blockquote>...yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.</blockquote>\n\n <p>So, what Paul is saying in Galatians 3:27 can\'t be that we need to be baptized to be justified, or saved, since baptism is a work that we need to do. Throughout the first three chapters of Galatians, Paul\'s consistent argument is that it is faith in Jesus <strong>alone</strong> that saves, apart from any work that we do.</p>\n\n <h4>Galatians 3:27 is referring to being baptized by the Holy Spirit, not by water</h4>\n\n <p class="first">There is nothing in the context of Galatians 3:27 to suggest that Paul is referring to water baptism here. Rather, we have good reason to believe that in Galatians 3:27, Paul is referring to being baptized by the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n <p>1 Corinthians 12:13 uses the same "baptized into" language as Galatians 3:27, and it clearly refers to baptism by the Holy Spirit:</p>\n\n <blockquote>For <strong>in one Spirit</strong> we were all baptized into one body&mdash;Jews or Greeks, slaves or free&mdash;and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Furthermore, we know that baptism by the Holy Spirit is a thing because John says this in John 1:33:</p>\n\n <blockquote>I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, "He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, <strong>this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit</strong>."</blockquote>\n\n <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n <p class="first">There is no good reason to believe that Galatians 3:27 teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation. Rather, it teaches that being baptized by the Holy Spirit, or, in other words, having the Holy Spirit dwell within us, which occurs through faith alone, is what is necessary for salvation.</p>\n</div>',

Immediately after writing, "Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you," Peter then writes, <strong>"not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience."</strong></p>\n\n <p>So, Peter is saying that the baptism he is describing does not actually remove dirt from the body, but actually represents <strong>belief, or faith,</strong>, or "an appeal to God."</p>\n\n <h4>Baptism is the public declaration of saving faith</h4>\n\n <p>The key to understanding <span class="scripture">1 Peter 3:21</span> is understanding that while it is the "appeal to God," or faith, that saves a person, Peter is using baptism as a <strong>representation</strong> of a person\'s saving faith. In other words, Peter is essentially equating baptism with faith. So, baptism saves a person because it is the public declaration, or representation, of faith, which is what truly saves the person.</p>\n</div>',

      '<div class="writing">\n <h3>The argument</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Some argue that Acts 22:16 teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation.</p>\n\n <blockquote>And now why do you wait? Rise and <strong>be baptized and wash away your sins</strong>, calling on his name.</blockquote>\n\n <p>The argument is that Acts 22:16 teaches that baptism is what actually "wash[es] away your sins," and so baptism is necessary for salvation.</p>\n\n <h3>First, we need to clarify the debate</h3>\n\n <h4>A better question</h4>\n\n <p class="first">The question, "Is baptism necessary for salvation?", is misleading. We believe that baptism is "necessary" for salvation in that baptism is commanded by God, and thus one who refuses baptism demonstrates a lack of true saving faith. A better question to use for framing this debate is, "At what point is a person saved: upon having faith, or upon being baptized?"</p>\n\n <h4>The key issue</h4>\n\n <p class="first">The key issue is not these individual passages, but rather, answering the question, "Does the Bible teach that salvation is through faith alone?" If the answer to that question is "Yes," then the question is, "What exactly does it mean to be saved through faith alone?"</p>\n\n <p>The value in debating these individual passages is simply to demonstrate that they do not contradict the doctrine of salvation through faith alone. However, we do not build our theology of salvation upon these individual passages. They are peripheral to the key issue, which is the doctrine of salvation through faith alone.</p>\n\n <h3>Responding to Acts 22:16</h3>\n\n <h4>Paul was saved before Acts 22:16</h4>\n\n <p class="first">In Galatians 1:11-12, Paul says that he did not receive the gospel from Ananias, but rather as a direct revelation when he was on the road to Damascus.</p>\n\n <blockquote>For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man’s gospel. For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</blockquote>\n\n <p>This means that Paul\'s faith in Christ existed before he met Ananias or was baptized, and thus that he was also saved before he met Ananias or was baptized.</p>\n\n <p>Furthermore, in Acts 26:12-18, when Paul recounts the events that happened on the road to Damascus, before he met Ananias or was baptized, Jesus appoints Paul as His servant and messenger. Paul could not be Jesus\' servant and messenger if he was not saved.</p>\n\n <p>From these passages, we can conclude that Paul was saved before he met Ananias or was baptized.</p>\n\n <h4>It was unique, and not normative, that Paul was saved before receiving the Holy Spirit</h4>\n\n <p class="first">Interestingly, Paul received the Holy Spirit in Acts 9:17, <strong>after</strong> being saved while on the road to Damascus. Something similar happened with the Samaritans in Acts 8:14-16.</p>\n\n <p>Essentially, this is not normative, since believers today receive the Holy Spirit at the same time as when they are saved. However, Acts is a transitional period between Old Testament believers and the Church, so it should not surprise us to see some unusual occurrences.</p>\n\n <p>In the Old Testament, believers were still saved through regeneration by the Holy Spirit and through faith, but they were not permanently indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Some believers instead received temporary indwellings of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n <p>Paul\'s situation and the Samaritans\' situation likely resembled the way Old Testament believers were saved, and this was because they lived during this transitional period between Old Testament believers and the church.</p>\n\n <h4>"Calling on" could also be translated, "having called on"</h4>\n\n <p class="first">The Greek word translated "calling on" is ἐπικαλεσάμενος (epikalesamenos), which is an aorist participle, which is an action that occurs either at the same time, or before, the main verb, which is "be baptized." So, ἐπικαλεσάμενος could also be translated as "having called on," which would more clearly describe the fact that Paul was saved before meeting Ananias and before being baptized.</p>\n\n <h4>"wash away your sins" could refer to what baptism symbolizes</h4>\n\n <p class="first">Baptism is a public declaration and a symbol of salvation. It <strong>represents</strong> the washing away of our sins. So, Acts 22:16 could simply be referring to what baptism symbolizes for the believer.</p>\n\n <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n <p class="first">For the reasons above, there is no reason to conclude that Acts 22:16 teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation.</p>\n</div>',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>What is the Athanasian Creed?</h3>\n \n <p class="first">The Athanasian Creed focuses on the Trinity and on the deity of Christ. Although Athanasius was most likely not the author of this creed, his name is attached to this creed because both he and the creed affirm strongly the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>\n \n <h3>The Athanasian Creed</h3>\n <p class="first">\n 1. Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold\n the catholic faith;\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 2. Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt\n he shall perish everlastingly.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 3. And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and\n Trinity in Unity;\n </p>\n\n <p>4. Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.</p>\n\n <p>\n 5. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another\n of the Holy Spirit.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 6. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is\n all one, the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 7. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 8. The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 9. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy\n Spirit incomprehensible.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 10. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.\n </p>\n\n <p>11. And yet they are not three eternals but one eternal.</p>\n\n <p>\n 12. As also there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensible, but\n one uncreated and one incomprehensible.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 13. So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy\n Spirit almighty.\n </p>\n\n <p>14. And yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.</p>\n\n <p>\n 15. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God;\n </p>\n\n <p>16. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.</p>\n\n <p>\n 17. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit\n Lord;\n </p>\n\n <p>18. And yet they are not three Lords but one Lord.</p>\n\n <p>\n 19. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge\n every Person by himself to be God and Lord;\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 20. So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say; There are three\n Gods or three Lords.\n </p>\n\n <p>21. The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.</p>\n\n <p>\n 22. The Son is of the Father alone; not made nor created, but begotten.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 23. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor\n created, nor begotten, but proceeding.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 24. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons;\n one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 25. And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or\n less than another.\n </p>\n\n <p>26. But the whole three persons are coeternal, and coequal.</p>\n\n <p>\n 27. So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the\n Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 28. He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 29. Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also\n believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 30. For the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus\n Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 31. God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and\n man of substance of His mother, born in the world.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 32. Perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh\n subsisting.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 33. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the\n Father as touching His manhood.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 34. Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 35. One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of\n that manhood into God.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 36. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 37. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one\n Christ;\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 38. Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the\n third day from the dead;\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 39. He ascended into heaven, He sits on the right hand of the Father, God,\n Almighty;\n </p>\n\n <p>40. From thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>\n\n <p>41. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies;</p>\n\n <p>42. and shall give account of their own works.</p>\n\n <p>\n 43. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting and they\n that have done evil into everlasting fire.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n 44. This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he\n cannot be saved.\n </p>\n </div>\n',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n <p class="first">First, here is a link to the original article that this post addresses: <a href="https://www.atheists.org/activism/resources/did-jesus-exist/" target="_blank">"Did Jesus Exist?"</a>. In this article, Zindler\'s thesis is that "It is easier to account for the facts of early Christian history if Jesus were a fiction than if he once were real."</p>\n\n <p>The purpose of this post is to demonstrate that Zindler\'s thesis is wrong. Here, we will not quote Zindler\'s entire article, but only the relevant parts.</p>\n\n <h3>Zindler compares Jesus to Zeus, Thor, Isir, and Osiris</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Even in the case of other deities, such as Zeus, Thor, Isis, and Osiris, I had always taken it for granted that they were merely deified human heroes: men and women who lived in the later stages of prehistory – persons whose reputations got better and better the longer the time elapsed after their deaths. Gods, like fine wines, I supposed, improved with age.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Comparing Jesus to "other deities" such as Zeus, Thor, Isis, and Osiris is absurd. The very obvious and enormous difference between Jesus and these other deities is that whereas Jesus has always been claimed to have been a very specific person who existed during a very specific time and place in actual history, having eyewitness accounts of specific things he did during his physical life on earth, these other deities have absolutely no such characteristics.</p>\n\n <p>If Zindler believes these other deities have these same characteristics that were just listed about Jesus, the burden of proof is upon him to demonstrate this. As it stands, there is simply no meaningful comparison between Jesus and other deities such as the ones Zindler listed.</p>\n\n <h3>Zindler\'s thesis</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">I now feel it is more reasonable to suppose he never existed. It is easier to account for the facts of early Christian history if Jesus were a fiction than if he once were real.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Three points to note here:</p>\n\n <p></p>\n\n <ol>\n <li>First, "more reasonable" is a very subjective position. After reading this post\'s responses to Zindler\'s arguments, one will just as easily be able to say that it is "more reasonable" to believe that Jesus existed. In fact, the fact that the large majority of people believe that Jesus existed points to his existence being "more reasonable" to believe than his non-existence.</li>\n <li>The definitive argument for Jesus\' existence does not rest in anything external to the Bible, but rather in presuppositional argumentation, which states that one must presuppose the Bible (or, that God has revealed Truth through the Bible) in order for Truth, logic, and knowledge to even be possible in the first place. Thus, one who denies the Bible denies the only legitimate explanation for knowledge itself. Presuppositional apologetics will be covered in another post.</li>\n <li>It\'s worthwhile to recognize that Zindler is biased. He wants to believe that Jesus did not exist, and so his interpretation of the facts will be biased in that direction.</li>\n </ol>\n\n <h3>The burden of proof</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Although what follows may fairly be interpreted to be a proof of the non-historicity of Jesus, it must be realized that the burden of proof does not rest upon the skeptic in this matter. As always is the case, the burden of proof weighs upon those who assert that some thing or some process exists. If someone claims that he never has to shave because every morning before he can get to the bathroom he is assaulted by a six-foot rabbit with extremely sharp teeth who trims his whiskers better than a razor – if someone makes such a claim, no skeptic need worry about constructing a disproof. Unless evidence for the claim is produced, the skeptic can treat the claim as false. This is nothing more than sane, every-day practice.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Just like before, when Zindler compares Jesus to other deities like Zeus and Thor, again Zindler makes an absurd comparison by comparing Jesus to "a six-foot rabbit...". Claiming that "a six-foot rabbit" exists is <strong>completely</strong> different from claiming that Jesus existed. It seems that Zindler is trying to manipulate the reader emotionally into thinking that believing in Jesus\' existence is akin to believing in something like "a six-foot rabbit," which is extremely deceptive.</p>\n\n <p>What are the obvious differences? Well, there are actual writings in history that describe in great detail actual things that Jesus did during his life, things for which there were eyewitness accounts, and there was an enormous movement that started, and continues strongly to this day, as a result of these things that Jesus did. There is physical, tangible, observable evidence that point strongly in the direction of Jesus\' existence. In contrast, the concept of this "six-foot rabbit" that Zindler brings up is utterly ridiculous at the start.</p>\n\n <p>As for the burden of proof, Zindler\'s logic is not convincing. It seems to be far more reasonable for the burden of proof to be upon those who do not believe Jesus existed, since the vast majority of people throughout history have believed in Jesus\' existence, and there are numerous physical documents that are used as evidence for Jesus\' existence.</p>\n\n <p>Of course, Zindler does attempt to show that these documents do not prove Jesus\' existence, but to purport that the burden of proof rests in the nearly-unanimous majority is simply untrue.</p>\n\n <h3>Comparing Jesus to Tiberius Caesar is irrelevant</h3>\n\n <p class="first">I generally agree that N.T. Wright\'s usage of Tiberius Caesar is not very helpful. Proving that Jesus existed versus proving that Tiberius Caesar existed are quite different tasks.</p>\n\n <p>We will skip responding to this section, since it is not directly relevant to proving Jesus\' existence. The evidences for Jesus\' existence are simply different than the evidences for Tiberius Caesar\'s existence, since they were very different men with very different roles in history.</p>\n\n <h3>The Old Testament "evidence"</h3>\n\n <p class="first">I generally agree with Zindler that the Old Testament is not directly relevant to the discussion of Jesus\' existence in terms of empirical evidence.</p>\n \n <p>However, I disagree with his statement that "All of the many examples of OT \'predictions\' of Jesus are so silly that one need only look them up to see their irrelevance." Since Zindler does not go any further into demonstrating the irrelevance of Old Testament prophecies, all I will say here is that, contrary to Zindler\'s claim, there is strong evidence that Jesus fulfills exactly the descriptions of many Old Testament prophecies, which points towards both Jesus\' existence and the reliability of the Bible. But, the better place for arguing for this position would be another post, since this is a different type of argument for Jesus\' existence than the ones we are examining here.</p>\n\n <h3>The New Testament evidence - Revelation</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">A third category of writing, apocalyptic, of which the Book of Revelation is an example, also exists, but it gives no support for the historicity of Jesus. In fact, it would appear to be an intellectual fossil of the thought-world from which Christianity sprang – a Jewish apocalypse that was reworked for Christian use. The main character of the book (referred to 28 times) would seem to be “the Lamb,” an astral being seen in visions (no claims to historicity here!), and the book overall is redolent of ancient astrology.</blockquote>\n\n <p>The book of revelation provides support for the historicity of Jesus in two ways:</p>\n\n <p></p>\n \n <ol>\n <li>Its author is John, one of Jesus\' apostles, an eyewitness of Jesus\' life. In a citation below, Zindler says that it is "extremely doubtful" that John was even a historical figure, but the burden of proof for this claim is certainly upon the skeptic, since the book itself says that the author is John and there was no dispute about Revelation\'s authorship until relatively recently.</li>\n <li>It references someone named Jesus, whom John knew and had a relationship with. It is illogical to believe that John is writing about an imaginary character he invented. Although the Jesus John refers to in Revelation is the post-resurrected, post-ascended Jesus, it can be assumed that this Jesus is the same Jesus that John knew while Jesus lived on the earth.</li>\n </ol>\n\n <p>Zindler\'s statement that the book of Revelation "is redolent of ancient astrology" is misleading and irrelevant. There are enough differences between the book of Revelation and "ancient astrology" that one cannot equate the two so simply.</p>\n\n <blockquote>The name Jesus occurs only seven times in the entire book, Christ only four times, and Jesus Christ only twice!</blockquote>\n\n <p>This is absolutely silly. The number of times "Jesus," "Christ," and "Jesus Christ" occur in Revelation is not an argument at all against John\'s portrayal of Jesus as a real person/being. There are many places in Revelation where John is clearly referring to Jesus without actually using his name, such as when John refers to "the lamb," so Jesus shows up in far more of the book of Revelation than Zindler would lead us to believe.</p>\n\n <p>It seems that Zindler\'s implication here is that the lack of times Jesus is specificlaly mentioned points to the fact that the author of Revelation simply took an existing story and added in a few references to Jesus. However, as mentioned above, Revelation contains far more references to Jesus, enough that the book of Revelation can be considered significantly different from other kinds of "ancient astrology."</p>\n\n <blockquote>While Revelation may very well derive from a very early period (contrary to the views of most biblical scholars, who deal with the book only in its final form), the Jesus of which it whispers obviously is not a man. He is a supernatural being. He has not yet acquired the physiological and metabolic properties of which we read in the gospels. The Jesus of Revelation is a god who would later be made into a man – not a man who would later become a god, as liberal religious scholars would have it.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Here are the numerous problems with this paragraph:</p>\n\n <p></p>\n \n <ol>\n <li>Oftentimes, when someone writes that "most biblical scholars" hold to a particular position, that person means "most biblical scholars that I consider legitimate, and I do not consider biblical scholars who hold a conservative view of the Bible to be legitimate." The term "most biblical scholars" is quite subjective and not at all an accurate or useful term when used in this way.</li>\n <li>Although the Jesus in Revelation is the post-resurrected, post-ascended Jesus, John still describes Jesus as having a human form, and we can assume that this is the same Jesus that John wrote about earlier as having lived and walked on the earth as a human man.</li>\n <li>The next few sentences are simply completely inaccurate. It is simply inaccurate that the Jesus in Revelation "has not yet acquired the physiological and metabolic properties of which we read in the gospels." Rather, the events in Revelation occur <strong>after</strong> the gospels, so in Revelation, Jesus has <strong>already</strong> lived his life on earth. The Jesus in Revelation is not at all "a god who would later be made into a man." Zindler is simply completely wrong in his understanding of Jesus in Revelation in this section of his article.</li>\n </ol>\n\n <h3>The Gospels</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">The notion that the four “gospels that made the cut” to be included in the official New Testament were written by men named Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John does not go back to early Christian times. The titles “According to Matthew,” etc., were not added until late in the second century.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Although the authors of the four gospels are not named in the gospels themselves, there was no dispute in the early church concerning their authorship. It was simply assumed that the four gospels were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The lack of debate in the early church concerning the authorship of the gospels points to the fact that they were indeed written by these authors.</p>\n\n <h4>Papias and Justin Martyr</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Thus, although Papias ca. 140 CE (‘Common Era’) knows all the gospels but has only heard of Matthew and Mark, Justin Martyr (ca. 150 CE) knows of none of the four supposed authors.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Here, Zindler\'s language is, at best, over-simplified and confusing, and, at worst, deceptive. Here are several points in response:</p>\n\n <p></p>\n \n <ol>\n <li>First, what exactly is "knows all the gospels but has only heard of Matthew and Mark" supposed to mean? I simply have no idea what "knows all the gospels" is supposed to mean, and the assertion, "but has only heard of Matthew and Mark" is extremely misleading. More accurately, Papias only mentions Matthew and Mark in the passage we have concerning what he says about gospel authorship. To conclude that Papias "has only heard" of the gospels mentioned in this passage requires an enormous leap of logic. He could simply not have written anything about the other gospels. We simply do not know.</li>\n <li>Second, ignoring everything else, it remains that Papias wrote about Matthew and Mark, and that Papias lived at a time that was very close to the time that the original authors would have lived. There are strong arguments that Papias\'s writing demonstrates that Mark was indeed the author of Mark and that Matthew\'s writing was likely the foundation upon which the Greek version of Matthew was based. Zindler unjustifiably dismisses the weight of Papias\'s writing by making another misleading statement concerning Justin Martyr, which we will examine in the third point below. For more information, see <a href="/bible/papias-authorship" target="_blank">Papias and gospel authorship</a>.</li>\n <li>Papias writes that Justin Martyr "knows of none of the four supposed authors," which is another very misleading statement. Just because Martyr does not mention any of the authors by name does not at all mean that he "knows of none of the four supposed authors." Zindler is making a completely unjustified assertion here, and not only that, Martyr\'s writings contain information that is relevant to Mark\'s authorship, which we will examine in the fourth point below.</li>\n <li>In his writings, Martyr mentions the "memoirs of [Peter]," and says that in these memoirs, it is written that Jesus changed the name of one of the apostles to Peter and also changed the name of the sons of Zebedee to Boanerges, meaning sons of thunder. These two events are not in the so-called Gospel of Peter, but they are both in the Gospel of Mark, and the second event is found <strong>only</strong> in Mark. Furthermore, Papias wrote that Mark was Peter\'s interpreter, which would lead us to believe that Mark was the author of Peter\'s memoirs. For more information, see <a href="/bible/martyr-authorship" target="_blank">Justin Martyr and the Authorship of Mark?</a></li>\n </ol>\n\n <h3>Irenaeus</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">It is only in 180 CE, with Irenaeus of Lyons, that we learn who wrote the four "canonical" gospels and discover that there are exactly four of them because there are four quarters of the earth and four universal winds. Thus, unless one supposes the argument of Irenaeus to be other than ridiculous, we come to the conclusion that the gospels are of unknown origin and authorship, and there is no good reason to suppose they are eye-witness accounts of a man named Jesus of Nazareth.</blockquote>\n\n <p>There is a huge problem with Zindler\'s logic here. To dismiss Irenaeus\'s statements concerning the authorship of the gospels simply because he finds <strong>something else</strong> Irenaeus wrote to be "ridiculous" is not logical at all. What Irenaeus says concerning the authorship of the gospels does not become negated because of something else Irenaeus says that is really not relevant to the dicussion of authorship.</p>\n\n <p>Because of all this, The conclusion that Zindler reaches is not at all valid. The writings of Papias, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus, as well as the lack of debate during this time concerning the authorship of the gospels, all point towards the traditional view that the gospels were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.</p>\n\n <blockquote>At a minimum, this forces us to examine the gospels to see if their contents are even compatible with the notion that they were written by eye-witnesses. We cannot even assume that each of the gospels had but one author or redactor.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Of course, we should examine these questions, but so far, we do not have good reason to believe anything other than that the gospels were each written by one author, and that these authors were eyewitnesses.</p>\n\n <h3>Matthew and Luke\'s usage of Mark</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">It is clear that the gospels of Matthew and Luke could not possibly have been written by an eye-witness of the tales they tell. Both writers plagiarize (largely word-for-word) up to 90% of the gospel of Mark, to which they add sayings of Jesus and would-be historical details.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Again, this is absolutely terrible reasoning from Zindler, as well as deceptive wording. A more position way of phrasing what Zindler writes is, "Both writers use Mark as a source, and they include additional details in specific ways to emphasize the particular message they are trying to communicate."</p>\n\n <p>That Matthew and Luke utilized ("plagiarized" is an unnecessarily loaded term) Mark does <strong>not at all</strong> lead to the conclusion that "Matthew and Luke could not possibly have been written by an eye-witness of the tales they tell."</p>\n\n <h3>Matthew and Luke\'s genealogies</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Ignoring the fact that Matthew and Luke contradict each other in such critical details as the genealogy of Jesus – and thus cannot both be correct –</blockquote>\n\n <p>There are several legitimate explanations for the seeming discrepency between Matthew and Luke\'s genealogies.</p>\n\n <h3>Work in progress...</h3>\n </div>\n',

      '<div class="writing">\n <h3>The argument</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Some argue that the gospel resurrection accounts are contradictory concerning where the angels were when the women appeared at the tomb. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n\n <blockquote>And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone <strong>and sat on it</strong>. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified." (Matthew 28:2-5)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>And <strong>entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side</strong>, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. And he said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him." (Mark 16:5-6)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when <strong>they went in</strong> they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold, <strong>two men stood by them</strong> in dazzling apparel. And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?" (Luke 24:2-6)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>And she saw two angels in white, <strong>sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet</strong>. They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him." (John 20:12-13)</blockquote>\n\n <p>Was there an angel sitting on a stone, a young man sitting on the right side inside the tomb, two men standing by the women, or one angel at the head and another at the feet of where Jesus had lain? The apparent contradiction is that whereas Matthew writes that an angel sat on the stone, the other three gospels say that the angels were inside the tomb.</p>\n\n <h3>A reasonable explanation</h3>\n\n <p class="first">In Matthew, what we know is that the angel was sitting on the stone when the guards saw him, and "for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men." It is reasonable to believe that after this happened, the angel in Matthew did not remain on the stone, but rather met the women when they went inside the tomb, as the other gospels report. Matthew simply does not tell us what occurs between when the guards responded to seeing the angel and when the women met the angel.</p>\n \n <p>The other three gospels all report that the angels met the women inside the tomb, so any seeming discrepancy there is minor and easily explained. The gospels simply use slightly different language to describe exactly where the angels were.</p>\n \n <p>For the argument that the earthquake, the angel coming, and the guards responding to seeing the angel occurred <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb, see the article, <a href="/answers/when-stone-rolled-away" target="_blank">When was the stone rolled away from the tomb? Did an earthquake occur?</a></p>\n \n <p>For the argument that there two angels at the tomb, see the article, <a href="/answers/how-many-angels-tomb" target="_blank">How many angels were at the tomb?</a></p>\n\n <h3>General notes</h3>\n\n <h4>The differences between the gospels point to their authenticity</h4>\n\n <p class="first">What would actually be <em>more</em> suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.</p>\n\n <p>However, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself. So, rather than producing doubt, the differences between the gospel accounts should actually make us more confident in the historicity of the resurrection accounts.</p>\n \n <h4>It is perfectly normal for eyewitness accounts to differ</h4>\n \n <p class="first">Not every witness to an event recalls all of the details perfectly, or in the exact same way, so we should expect various accounts of the resurrection events to differ from one another.</p>\n \n <h4>The key is that there are no irreconcilable contradictions</h4>\n \n <p class="first">As long as we can provide <strong>possibilities</strong> for how the various resurrection accounts could reconcile into one coherent narrative, then there would be no irreconcilable, or necessary contradiction. This would then allow us to continue believing in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible without any compromise.</p>\n \n <h4>"But, I\'m not convinced by your explanations. I still think these are irreconcilable contradictions."</h4>\n \n <p class="first">It\'s likely that non-believers won\'t accept the possible explanations that we provide concerning reconciling the apparent contradictions in the resurrection narratives. However, their refusal to accept these explanations is not based upon the fact that reasonable and possible explanations have been provided, but simply upon the fact that they don\'t <strong>want</strong> to believe that there are legitimately reasonable and possible explanations.</p>\n \n <p>Their goal is simply to continue justifying their unbelief in the Bible, regardless of any fact or explanation provided to them. So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do. We should inform them that they are being unreasonable and stubborn, and that they are simply trying to shut their minds to the truth.</p>\n</div>',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>The alleged problem</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Supposedly, Genesis 1 and 2 are contradictory concerning when plants were created.</p>\n\n <h4>Genesis 1:11-13</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, <strong>the third day</strong>.</blockquote>\n\n <h4>Genesis 1:26-31</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Then God said, “Let us make man"... And there was evening and there was morning, <strong>the sixth day</strong>.</blockquote>\n\n <h4>Genesis 2:5-9</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">When <strong>no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up</strong>—-for the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground, and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground—-<strong>then the Lord God formed the man of dust</strong> from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. <strong>And the Lord God planted a garden</strong> in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. And <strong>out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree</strong> that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</blockquote>\n\n <p>From these passages, it seems that in Genesis 1, plants are created <strong>before</strong> man, and in Genesis 2, plants are created <strong>after</strong> man. Two solutions have been proposed for this apparent contradiction, one of which is problematic and the other of which is the better solution.</p>\n\n <h3>The better solution</h3>\n\n <p class="first">The key to this solution is recognizing the <strong>difference</strong> between the plants in Genesis 1 and the plants in Genesis 2. In Genesis 2, we see the key words <strong>of the field</strong>, which do not show up in Genesis 1.</p>\n\n <blockquote>When no bush <strong>of the field</strong> was yet in the land and no small plant <strong>of the field</strong> had yet sprung up...</blockquote>\n\n <img src="http://bibleanswers.io/static/images/garden.png" class="image-left">\n\n <p>The key difference between the plants in Genesis 1 and the plants in Genesis 2 is that the plants in Genesis 2 are <strong>plants that are cared for by humans, or plants in a garden</strong>. Before humans were created, there would be no gardeners or gardens, so obviously these kinds of plants (plants <strong>of the field</strong>) would not be in existence yet.</p>\n\n <p>Genesis 2 is not saying that wild vegetation did not exist before man was created, but rather that plants cared for by man did not exist before man was created. We can imply that while plants <strong>of the field</strong> were not created before man, wild vegetation indeed were created before man.</p>\n\n <p>Since the same author wrote Genesis 1 and 2, we should assume that this author would not write such an obvious contradiction, and indeed, we find a very clear solution to the alleged contradiction.</p>\n\n <h3>The problematic solution</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Some people try to solve this problem by saying that the creation account in Genesis is not a genre that we should take literally or as historical. They might say that it is poetry, or that it is a "creation narrative" that has different rules for interpretation than a historical narrative.</p>\n\n <p>The problem with this attempted solution is that the creation account in Genesis flows directly into what is clearly historical narrative, and it is unlikely that there is such a division between the genre of the earlier chapters of Genesis and the genre of the later chapters.</p>\n\n <p>Furthermore, this attempted solution causes us to lose faith in the Bible. If the creation account in Genesis can be considered contradictory and thus not to be taken literally, then this will start to chip away at our confidence in other parts of the Bible.</p>\n\n <p>The better solution presented above makes complete sense, so it should be strongly preferred over the problematic solution that was just presented.</p>\n </div>\n',

      '\n<div class="writing">\n <h3>Who is Papias?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">What we know about Papias comes from references in the works of Irenaeus of Lyons and Eusebius of Caesarea.

Eusebius writes that Papias was Bishop of Hierapolis around the time of Ignatius of Antioch.[1]\n\n <h3>When did Papias live?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Papias\'s writing is dated by most modern scholars to be about 95&ndash;120.[2][3] Irenaeus, who was Polycarp\'s disciple, describes Papias as "an ancient man who was a hearer of John and a companion of Polycarp."[4] Polycarp is said to have been a disciple of John by Irenaeus and Tertullian.[5][6]</p>\n\n <p>What all of this means is that Papias supposedly had direct contact with a man who had direct contact with John, which places Papias extremely close to the original writing of the gospels. This gives what he says about the authorship of the gospels great weight.</p>\n\n <h3>What does Papias write concerning gospel authorship?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">This passage is from Eusebius\'s writings. Emphasis is added.</p>\n\n <blockquote>[Papias, who is now mentioned by us, <strong>affirms that he received the sayings of the apostles from those who accompanied them, and he moreover asserts that he heard in person Aristion and the presbyter John</strong>. Accordingly he mentions them frequently by name, and in his writings gives their traditions. Our notice of these circumstances may not be without its use. It may also be worth while to add to the statements of Papias already given, other passages of his in which he relates some miraculous deeds, stating that he acquired the knowledge of them from tradition. The residence of the Apostle Philip with his daughters in Hierapolis has been mentioned above. We must now point out how Papias, who lived at the same time, relates that he had received a wonderful narrative from the daughters of Philip. For he relates that a dead man was raised to life in his day. He also mentions another miracle relating to Justus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a deadly poison, and received no harm, on account of the grace of the Lord. The same person, moreover, has set down other things as coming to him from unwritten tradition, amongst these some strange parables and instructions of the Saviour, and some other things of a more fabulous nature. Amongst these he says that there will be a millennium after the resurrection from the dead, when the personal reign of Christ will be established on this earth. He moreover hands down, in his own writing, other narratives given by the previously mentioned Aristion of the Lord\'s sayings, and the traditions of the presbyter John. For information on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books themselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add, as being a matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding Mark who wrote the Gospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words]: And the presbyter said this. <strong>Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord\'s sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements.</strong> [This is what is related by Papias regarding Mark; but with regard to Matthew he has made the following statements]: <strong>Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.</strong> [The same person uses proofs from the First Epistle of John, and from the Epistle of Peter in like manner. And he also gives another story of a woman who was accused of many sins before the Lord, which is to be found in the Gospel according to the Hebrews.][7]</blockquote>\n\n <h3>Mark wrote what he heard from Peter</h3>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord\'s sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements.</blockquote>\n\n <p>This passage tells us that Mark recorded what he heard from Peter. This is very strong evidence that Mark is indeed the author of the book of Mark that is one of the four gospels.</p>\n\n <h4>Matthew wrote in the Hebrew language</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Here, Papias writes that Matthew wrote "in the Hebrew language." However the book of Matthew that we have is written in Greek. There are two possible explanations for this:</p>\n\n <p></p>\n\n <ol>\n <li>Someone else translated Matthew\'s original work into Greek. This would still mean that Matthew is the original author of the book.</li>\n <li>Matthew perhaps also knew Greek and translated his Hebrew work into the Greek language afterwards.</li>\n </ol>\n\n <p>In any case, what Papias writes here is strong evidence that Matthew is indeed the original author, whether of the Hebrew original or also of the Greek translation, of the book of Matthew that is one of the four gospels.</p>\n \n</div>\n',

      '<div class="writing">\n <h3>The argument</h3>\n \n <p class="first">Some argue that predestination in the Bible merely means that God predestined those whom he foreknew would freely choose to have faith in Jesus. In other words, rather than directly causing anyone to have faith, predestination simpy involves God looking down the corridor of time to see which humans would choose Jesus themselves.</p>\n \n <p>The primary two passages used to support this view of predestination are Romans 8:29 and 1 Peter 1:1-2.</p>\n \n <blockquote>For those whom he <strong>foreknew</strong> he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</blockquote>\n \n <blockquote>...To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the <strong>foreknowledge</strong> of God the Father...</blockquote>\n \n <p>The argument is that this passage teaches that God\'s predestination is based upon his "foreknowledge," which is merely passive knowledge of what humans would freely decide for themselves&mdash;predestination is not God actively deciding exactly whom He would save.</p>\n \n <h3>The response</h3>\n \n <p class="first">The key to responding to this argument against the Calvinistic view of predestination is recognizing that this argument\'s definition of God\'s "foreknowledge" does not come from the Bible, but rather imposes an outside definition of "foreknowledge" upon the Bible. In the Bible, God\'s "foreknowledge" is not passive, but is actually active. Here is what Jeremiah 1:5 says concerning God\'s "foreknowledge" of Jeremiah:</p>\n \n <blockquote>Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.</blockquote>\n \n <p>In this passage, we learn that God "knew" Jeremiah "before" he was born, or He "foreknew" Jeremiah. However, here, God\'s "foreknowledge" of Jeremiah is not a foreknowledge of what kind of a person Jeremiah would be, but rather an active determining of the life that Jeremiah would live. Jeremiah did not choose himself to become a "prophet to the nations," but rather, God "foreknew" Jeremiah and determined that he would become a "prophet to the nations."</p>\n \n <h4>The difference between predestination and God\'s foreknowledge</h4>\n \n <p class="first">Some object to this view of God\'s foreknowledge because they claim that this makes predestination and God\'s foreknowledge the same thing, whereas there is a clear distinction between the two in Romans 8.</p>\n \n <p>However, this is a false claim because there is indeed a significant difference between predestination and God\'s foreknowledge. God\'s foreknowledge of a person involves God actively fore-loving a person (not passively waiting to see how that person would respond to Jesus in the future), and predestination refers to the specific plan that God has set in motion to save that person. They are both part of the Golden Chain in Romans 8. One leads to the other; God\'s foreknowledge leads to predestination.</p>\n \n <p>Here are several passages that help us understand that God\'s "foreknowledge" of a person is an active fore-loving of that person, rather than a passive knowledge of what that person would do.</p>\n \n <p>In the very same chapter as 1 Peter 1:1-2, we find a clarification concerning what God\'s "foreknowledge" is:</p>\n \n <blockquote>He was <strong>foreknown</strong> before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you...</blockquote>\n \n <p>In this passage, we learn that Jesus was "foreknown" by God. However, this "foreknowledge" of Christ is clearly not just a passive knowledge about Christ, but is rather an active, intimate love of Christ.</p>\n \n <p>Exodus 33:17 says this:</p>\n \n <blockquote>And the Lord said to Moses, "This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I <strong>know</strong> you by name."</blockquote>\n \n <p>Again, we see here that God\'s knowledge of Moses is not a mere passive knowledge, but rather involves love and intimacy. It implies a personal relationship with the one whom God "knows."</p>\n \n <p>Amos 3:2 also helps us understand God\'s "knowing" something:</p>\n \n <blockquote>You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</blockquote>\n \n <p>Again, here, we see that God\'s "knowledge" of Israel is not passive at all, but involves a personal relationship with Israel. God does not just know about Israel; He knows Israel personally and intimately.</p>\n \n <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n \n <p>When we use the Bible to define God\'s "foreknowledge," we find that God\'s "foreknowledge" does not undermind the Calvinistic view of predestination at all, but rather enhances our understanding of predestination. God\'s "foreknowledge" and "knowledge" of a person involves a fore-loving of that person, as well as a personal and intimate relationship with that person. It is not passive at all, but rather leads to action on God\'s part, or a "predestining" of that person to a particular end.</p>\n</div>',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>Who was Irenaeus?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Irenaeus was the bishop of Lyon and helped develop Christian theology by battling heresy and defending orthodoxy. He died about 202 A.D. and he heard the preaching of Polycarp, who is known to have heard John directly. This paces Irenaeus extremely close to the original sources of the gospels.</p>\n\n <p>Irenaeus\'s writing contains the first mention of all four of the gospel authors together in one place.</p>\n\n <h3>What does Irenaeus write about gospel authorship?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Here is the relevant passage from Irenaeus\'s writings:</p>\n\n <blockquote>For, after our Lord rose from the dead, [the apostles] were invested with power from on high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them], were filled from all [His gifts], and had perfect knowledge: they departed to the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things [sent] from God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who indeed do all equally and individually possess the Gospel of God. Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia.<span class="superscript"><a class="reference" href="#footnote-1" id="text-1">[1]</a></span></blockquote>\n\n <p>More specifically, here is what Irenaeus writes specifically concerning each of the four gospels:</p>\n\n <h4>Matthew</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church.</blockquote>\n\n <p>This passage matches with what Papias writes concerning Matthew. It is likely that the gospel of Matthew was originally written by Matthew in Hebrew, and then later translated into Greek, either by Matthew himself or by someone else.</p>\n\n <h4>Mark</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Along with passages from Papias and Justin Martyr\'s writings, this passage from Irenaeus tells us that the gospel of Mark was written by Mark, who wrote what he heard from Peter, who was an eyewitness of Jesus\' life.</p>\n\n <h4>Luke</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached by him.</blockquote>\n\n <p>In addition to this passage, there is also significant internal evidence within the Bible which points towards Luke being the author of the gospel of Luke.</p>\n\n <h4>John</h4>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia.</blockquote>\n\n <p>Here, Irenaeus gives context into why John\'s two writings, the gospel of John and Revelation, are written later than the other gospels.</p>\n\n <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Due to how close Irenaeus is to the original authorship of the four gospels, it is very reasonable to simply take Irenaeus at his word when he names the authors of each of the gospels.</p>\n\n <p>Those who want to say that the authorship of the gospels is in serious doubt must undertake logical gymnastics to explain away what Irenaeus clearly writes concerning the authorship of the gospels.</p>\n \n </div>\n',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>Who is Cornelius Tacitus?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Cornelius Tacitus was a Roman historian who lived during the reigns of many Roman emperors, from about A.D. 55-120. He has been called the "greatest historian" of ancient Rome (Habermas, VHCELJ, 87).</p>\n\n <h3>What did Tacitus write about Jesus?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">One of his most famous works is the <em>Annals</em>, which covers the period from Augustus\'s death in A.D. 14 to Nero\'s death in A.D. 68. In the <em>Annals</em>, when writing about Nero, Tacitus mentions the death of Jesus, using a common misspelling of Christ, "Christus":</p>\n\n <blockquote>But not all the relief that could come from man, not all the Bounties that the prince could bestow, nor all the atonements which could be presented to the gods, availed to relieve Nero From the infamy of being believed to have ordered the conflagration, the fire of Rome. Hence to suppress the rumor, he falsely charged with the guilt, and punished Christians, who were hated for their enormities. <strong>Christus, the founder of the name, was put to death by Pontius Pilate</strong>, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius: but <strong>the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time broke out again</strong>, not only through Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their Center and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. (Annals XV, 44)</blockquote>\n\n <p>There are four things of particular note in this passage:</p>\n\n <p></p>\n\n <ol>\n <li>Tacitus is a trustworthy source because he is neither Christian nor Jewish</li>\n <li>Tacitus\'s mention of "Christus" demonstrates that Jesus actually existed and lived.</li>\n <li>The statement that Jesus was put to death by Pontius Pilate corroborates what the Bible teaches</li>\n <li>Tacitus\'s mention of "the pernicious superstition" alludes to Jesus\' resurrection</li>\n </ol>\n\n <p>This passage from Tacitus\'s writings is strong evidence that Jesus not only existed, but was also crucified, and it also suggests that a large number of people believed that Jesus resurrected from the dead.</p>\n </div>\n',

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p class="first">Some people argue that Acts 2:38 teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. (Acts 2:38)</blockquote>\n  \n <h3>First, we need to clarify the debate</h3>\n\n <h4>A better question</h4>\n\n <p class="first">The question, "Is baptism necessary for salvation?", is misleading. We believe that baptism is "necessary" for salvation in that baptism is commanded by God, and thus one who refuses baptism demonstrates a lack of true saving faith. A better question to use for framing this debate is, "At what point is a person saved: upon having faith, or upon being baptized?"</p>\n\n <h4>The key issue</h4>\n\n <p class="first">The key issue is not these individual passages, but rather, answering the question, "Does the Bible teach that salvation is through faith alone?" If the answer to that question is "Yes," then the question is, "What exactly does it mean to be saved through faith alone?"</p>\n\n <p>The value in debating these individual passages is simply to demonstrate that they do not contradict the doctrine of salvation through faith alone. However, we do not build our theology of salvation upon these individual passages. They are peripheral to the key issue, which is the doctrine of salvation through faith alone.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Responding to Acts 2:38</h3>\n  \n  <h4 class="first">"for" can mean several things</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">The key to Acts 2:38 is understanding exactly what the Greek word translated, "for," really means in the context of this passage.</p>\n  \n  <p>Those who say that baptism is necessary for baptism assert that it means, "in order to get." However, in both the Greek and English language, "for" can mean several things, so there are other interpretations of this passage that do not result in the conclusion that baptism is necessary for salvation. Here are two definitions for the word "for" from Merriam-Webster:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n    <li>used as a function word to indicate an intended goal ("be baptized for the goal of the forgiveness of your sins")</li>\n    <li>because of ("be baptized because you have been forgiven of your sins")</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h4>What does "for" mean in this passage?</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">To determine what the word "for" means in Acts 2:38, we need to look back to the original language. The word translated "for" in Acts 2:38 is εἰς (eis). εἰς is used 1,774 times in the New Testament, and it is translated several different ways.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, how do we determine what εἰς means in Acts 2:38? Well, there are several similar passages in the Bible where it is clear that εἰς means "because of":</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Matthew 12:41</strong> - "The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented <strong>at</strong> (εἰς) the preaching of Jonah..."</p>\n      <p>In Matthew 12:41, the Greek word εἰς is translated, "at," and it is clear here that the people of Ninevah repented <strong>because of</strong>, or <strong>as a result of</strong>, the preaching of Jonah.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p class="first"><strong>Matthew 3:11</strong> - "I baptize you with water <strong>for</strong> (εἰς) repentance"</p>\n      <p>Here, it is clear that people are baptized with water <strong>because</strong> they repented, not <strong>in order to get</strong> repentance.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p class="first"><strong>Romans 6:3</strong> - "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized <strong>into</strong> (εἰς) his death?"</p>\n      <p>Again, it is clear here that people are being baptized <strong>because of</strong> Jesus\' death, not <strong>in order to receive</strong> his death, which would not make any sense.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p class="first"><strong>1 Corinthians 10:2</strong> - "and all were baptized <strong>into</strong> (εἰς) Moses in the cloud and in the sea"</p>\n      <p>In this passage, it is clear that the Israelites were baptized <strong>because</strong> Moses was their leader and had led them out of Egypt, not <strong>in order to get</strong> Moses to be their leader.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>The last three passages above are the only other passages, besides Acts 2:38, where the Greek word εἰς is used in conjunction with "baptism." There are additional passages we could reference in which εἰς clearly means "because of," and not "in order to get."</p>\n  \n  <p>To summarize, although it is <em>possible</em> that the word "for" in Acts 2:38 could mean "in order go get" (from a translation standpoint), due to the passages we mentioned above, it is far more likely that the word "for" actually means "because of" in this passage.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Plural and singular pronouns</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">There is something else about Acts 2:38 that supports the position that the passages does not teach that baptism is necessary for salvation. In this passage, there are two different kinds of verbs and pronouns: 1) second person plural, and 2) third person singular.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote><strong>Repent (second person plural)</strong> and <strong>be baptized (third person singular)</strong> every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of <strong>your (second person plural)</strong> sins (Acts 2:38)</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Notice that "repent" and "the forgiveness of your sins" are in the second person plural, and "be baptized" is in the third person singular. This suggests that "repenting" and "the forgiveness of your sins" are directly connected in this passage, while "be baptized" is an act that is separate from those two things.</p>\n  \n  <p>In other words, we can paraphrase Acts 2:38 this way: "You all repent for the forgiveness of all of your sins, and let each one of your be baptized."</p>\n  \n  <h4>The Negative Inference Fallacy</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">Another problem with the argument that Acts 2:38 teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation is the Negative Inference Fallacy, which says that just because a statement is true, that does not mean all opposites of that statement are true.</p>\n  \n  <p>For example, if I say, "Eat an apple to be healthy," that does not mean that if a person does <strong>not</strong> eat an apple he will <strong>not</strong> be healthy.</p>\n  \n  <p>Likewise, Acts 2:38 says that a person who is baptized has received the forgiveness of sins. However, this does not necessarily mean that a person who has <strong>not</strong> been baptized has <strong>not</strong> received the forgiveness of sins.</p>\n  \n  <p>To put this concept in a different way, there is a difference between the <strong>fruit</strong> of salvation and the <strong>cause</strong> of salvation. Baptism and good works are the <strong>fruit</strong> of salvation and are "necessary" in the sense that a person who is truly saved will desire these things. However, the <strong>cause</strong> of salvation is faith, which means that a person is saved <strong>before</strong> baptism and obedience to God occur. So, a person who is not yet baptized or has not yet begun obeying God with good works can still be saved.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Later in Acts: Cornelius</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">Another argument that Acts 2:38 does not teach that baptism is necessary for salvation is what we read later in the book of Acts itself. In Acts 10:43, Peter says this:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Here, Peter tells Cornelius that "everyone who believes" in Jesus "receives forgiveness of sins through his name." He does not mention baptism being required in order to receive forgiveness of sins.</p>\n  \n  <p>After Peter says this to Cornelius, Acts 10:44 says this:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Then, <strong>after</strong> this, the Cornelius and the Gentiles are baptized:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>Then Peter declared, "Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" (Acts 10:46-47)</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>So, the order of events is this:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n    <li>First, Cornelius and the Gentiles believe, receive forgiveness of sins, and the Holy Spirit falls on them.</li>\n    <li>Then, <strong>after</strong> all of these things happen, Peter recognizes that since they have received the forgiveness of their sins, they should be baptized.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p class="first">For all of the reasons above, it is clear that Acts 2:38 does not teach that baptism is necessary for salvation.</p>\n</div',

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <h3>What does Justin Martyr write about the authorship of Mark?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Although Justin does not directly reference the book of Mark, reasoning based upon Justin\'s writing leads us to believe that Mark is indeed the author of the book of Mark. Here is what Justin writes:</p>\n\n <blockquote>And when it is said that He changed the name of one of the apostles to Peter; and when it is written in the memoirs of Him that this so happened, as well as that He changed the names of other two brothers, the sons of Zebedee, to Boanerges, which means sons of thunder...<span class="superscript"><a class="reference" href="#footnote-1" id="text-1">[1]</a></span></blockquote>\n\n <p>Here, Justin refers to the "memoirs of [Peter]," and he writes that in these memoirs, it is written that Jesus "changed the name of one of the apostles to Peter" and "changed the names of other two brothers, the sons of Zebedee, to Boanerges."</p>\n \n <h3>Gospel of Peter or Gospel of Mark?</h3>\n\n <p class="first">In a debate with Richard Bauckham on the radio show "Unbelievable," popular New Testament critic Bart Ehrman comments concerning this passage, "he doesn\'t call them by our Gospels... the only memoir he names is the memoirs of Peter... he\'s talking about the Gospel of Peter."</p>\n\n <p>However, the problem with Ehrman\'s statement is that whereas the so-called Gospel of Peter nowhere mentions any event where Jesus changes Peter\'s name or changes the names of the sons of Zebedee, the Gospel of Mark <strong>does</strong> include both of these events. In fact, the Gospel of Mark is the <strong>only</strong> gospel that includes the event of Jesus changing the names of the sons of Zebedee. In Mark 3:16-17, we read:</p>\n\n <blockquote>He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);</blockquote>\n\n <p>From this, we can conclude that Justin\'s reference to the "memoirs of [Peter]" is a reference to the book of the gospels that we call Mark. This matches exactly with what we know about the relationship between Peter and Mark, namely, that Mark interpreted and wrote on behalf of Peter (see <a href="/answers/bible/papias-authorship">Papias and gospel authorship</a> for what Papias writes about this).</p>\n\n <p>Thus, Justin\'s writing provides support for the traditional authorship of the gospel of Mark.</p>\n \n </div>\n',

      '<div class="writing">\n <h3>The argument</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Some argue that the gospel accounts are contradictory concerning when the women arrived at the tomb. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n\n <blockquote>Now after the Sabbath, <strong>toward the dawn</strong> of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. (Matthew 28:1)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And <strong>very early</strong> on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. (Mark 16:1-2)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>But on the first day of the week, <strong>at early dawn</strong>, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. (Luke 24:1)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, <strong>while it was still dark</strong>, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. (John 20:1)</blockquote>\n\n <p>The apparent contradiction is that John says that Mary Magdelene went to the tomb "while it was still dark," while Matthew and Luke say that they went at "dawn."</p>\n\n <h3>Two reasonable explanations</h3>\n\n <p class="first">There are at least two reasonable explanations for the apparent contradiction concerning when the women went to the tomb.</p>\n\n <p></p>\n \n <ol>\n <li>Much of the sky is still dark when it begins to dawn very early in the morning.</li>\n <li>Perhaps John is saying that it was dark when Mary/the women <em>left</em> for the tomb, and it was dawn when they <em>arrived</em>. If the women had stayed in Bethany, as they did earlier in the week, they would have needed to travel about two miles to reach the tomb, which would have been plenty of time for the sky to change (<span class="scripture">John 11:18</span>).</li>\n </ol>\n \n <p class="after-list">As we can see from these possible explanations, there is no necessary contradiction between the gospel accounts concerning when the women arrived at the tomb.</p>\n \n <h3>General notes</h3>\n\n <h4>The differences between the gospels point to their authenticity</h4>\n\n <p class="first">What would actually be <em>more</em> suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.</p>\n\n <p>However, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself. So, rather than producing doubt, the differences between the gospel accounts should actually make us more confident in the historicity of the resurrection accounts.</p>\n \n <h4>It is perfectly normal for eyewitness accounts to differ</h4>\n \n <p class="first">Not every witness to an event recalls all of the details perfectly, or in the exact same way, so we should expect various accounts of the resurrection events to differ from one another.</p>\n \n <h4>The key is that there are no irreconcilable contradictions</h4>\n \n <p class="first">As long as we can provide <strong>possibilities</strong> for how the various resurrection accounts could reconcile into one coherent narrative, then there would be no irreconcilable, or necessary contradiction. This would then allow us to continue believing in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible without any compromise.</p>\n \n <h4>"But, I\'m not convinced by your explanations. I still think these are irreconcilable contradictions."</h4>\n \n <p class="first">It\'s likely that non-believers won\'t accept the possible explanations that we provide concerning reconciling the apparent contradictions in the resurrection narratives. However, their refusal to accept these explanations is not based upon the fact that reasonable and possible explanations have been provided, but simply upon the fact that they don\'t <strong>want</strong> to believe that there are legitimately reasonable and possible explanations.</p>\n \n <p>Their goal is simply to continue justifying their unbelief in the Bible, regardless of any fact or explanation provided to them. So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do. We should inform them that they are being unreasonable and stubborn, and that they are simply trying to shut their minds to the truth.</p>\n</div>',

      '<div class="writing">\n <h3>The argument</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Some argue that the gospel resurrection accounts are contradictory concerning how many women went to the tomb. Here are the relevant passages:</p>\n\n <blockquote class="first">Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, <strong>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary</strong> went to see the tomb. (Matthew 28:1)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>When the Sabbath was past, <strong>Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome</strong> bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. (Mark 16:1)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, <strong>they</strong> went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared... Now it was <strong>Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women</strong> with them who told these things to the apostles. (Luke 24:1, 10)</blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>Now on the first day of the week <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. (John 20:1)</blockquote>\n\n <p>Who went to the tomb? Was it just Mary Magdelene? Was it just the two Marys? Or was it a group of at least five women (the two Marys, Salome, and "other women"), as Luke records?</p>\n\n <h3>A reasonable explanation</h3>\n\n <p class="first">There were at least five women who went to the tomb, as Luke records. Matthew does not say that <em>only</em> the two Marys went to the tomb, Mark does not say that <em>only</em> those three women went to the tomb, and John does not say that <em>only</em> Mary Magdelene went to the tomb. In fact, it is clear from John\'s account that other women were with Mary, since she says in <span class="scripture">John 20:2</span>, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and <strong>we</strong> do not know where they have laid him."</p>\n\n <p>There is simply no necessary contradiction between the resurrection accounts concerning how many women went to the tomb.</p>\n \n <h3>General notes</h3>\n\n <h4>The differences between the gospels point to their authenticity</h4>\n\n <p class="first">What would actually be <em>more</em> suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.</p>\n\n <p>However, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself. So, rather than producing doubt, the differences between the gospel accounts should actually make us more confident in the historicity of the resurrection accounts.</p>\n \n <h4>It is perfectly normal for eyewitness accounts to differ</h4>\n \n <p class="first">Not every witness to an event recalls all of the details perfectly, or in the exact same way, so we should expect various accounts of the resurrection events to differ from one another.</p>\n \n <h4>The key is that there are no irreconcilable contradictions</h4>\n \n <p class="first">As long as we can provide <strong>possibilities</strong> for how the various resurrection accounts could reconcile into one coherent narrative, then there would be no irreconcilable, or necessary contradiction. This would then allow us to continue believing in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible without any compromise.</p>\n \n <h4>"But, I\'m not convinced by your explanations. I still think these are irreconcilable contradictions."</h4>\n \n <p class="first">It\'s likely that non-believers won\'t accept the possible explanations that we provide concerning reconciling the apparent contradictions in the resurrection narratives. However, their refusal to accept these explanations is not based upon the fact that reasonable and possible explanations have been provided, but simply upon the fact that they don\'t <strong>want</strong> to believe that there are legitimately reasonable and possible explanations.</p>\n \n <p>Their goal is simply to continue justifying their unbelief in the Bible, regardless of any fact or explanation provided to them. So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do. We should inform them that they are being unreasonable and stubborn, and that they are simply trying to shut their minds to the truth.</p>\n</div>',

      "<div class=\"writing\">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  <p>Cain's wife was one of his sisters. God did not prohibit sexual relations with one's close relative until Leviticus 18:6. One purpose of incest laws was to protect people from birth defects, but Cain lived during an early time when the genetic pool was still very pure.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>SOme argue that if Adam and Eve are the father and mother of all humankind, then Cain could not have found his wife. Here is the relevant passage:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>Then Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. (Genesis 4:16-17)</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>The argument is that if Cain found a wife in a foreign land, then Adam and Eve must not be the parents of every human.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <h4>Adam had other sons and daughters</h4>\n  \n  <p>In Genesis 5:4, we learn that Adam had other sons and daughters besides his first three children:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>This means that Adam had daughters, one of whom could have been Cain's wife.</p>\n  \n  <h4>God did not prohibit incest until Leviticus 18:6</h4>\n  \n  <p>Incest was not prohibited by God until Leviticus 18:6, at which point, God says, \"None of you shall approach any one of his close relatives to uncover nakedness. I am the Lord.\"</p>\n  \n  <h4>Perhaps incest did not become dangerous until later in time</h4>\n  \n  <p>It is very possible that having sexual relationships with one's close relatives was not dangerous during the early period that Cain lived because the people were so close to Adam that the genetic pool was still extremely pure.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, as time progressed, and people's genes became more and more polluted because of sin, incest became more and more dangerous. Then, at some point in history, God prohibited incest to protect babies from birth defects due to greater risks with producing children with close relatives.</p>\n  \n  <p>This means that during the early period before God gave this command against incest, people would have married and produced offspring with close relatives, including siblings.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p>Cain's wife was his sister, and there was no problem with this likely because of the purity of the gene pool during this early period in time. Therefore, we have no problem in continuing to affirm the Bible's teaching that Adam and Eve are the ancestors of every human being.</p>\n</div",

      '<div class="writing">\n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p class="first">Some argue that John 3:5 teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." (John 3:5)</blockquote>\n  \n  <h3>First, we need to clarify the debate</h3>\n\n <h4>A better question</h4>\n\n <p class="first">The question, "Is baptism necessary for salvation?", is misleading. We believe that baptism is "necessary" for salvation in that baptism is commanded by God, and thus one who refuses baptism demonstrates a lack of true saving faith. A better question to use for framing this debate is, "At what point is a person saved: upon having faith, or upon being baptized?"</p>\n\n <h4>The key issue</h4>\n\n <p class="first">The key issue is not these individual passages, but rather, answering the question, "Does the Bible teach that salvation is through faith alone?" If the answer to that question is "Yes," then the question is, "What exactly does it mean to be saved through faith alone?"</p>\n\n <p>The value in debating these individual passages is simply to demonstrate that they do not contradict the doctrine of salvation through faith alone. However, we do not build our theology of salvation upon these individual passages. They are peripheral to the key issue, which is the doctrine of salvation through faith alone.</p>\n \n <h3>Responding to John 3:5</h3>\n \n <h4 class="first">What does "born of water" mean?</h4>\n \n <p class="first">The key to answering the assertion that John 3:5 teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation is determining what exactly the phrase, "born of water," means.</p>\n \n <p>There are several reasons to believe that "born of water" in John 3:5 is <strong>not</strong> referring to baptism</p>\n \n <h4>1. Baptism is not mentioned</h4>\n \n  <p>First, baptism is never mentioned explicitly in John 3:5 or in its context. It is merely asserted by some that "born of water" must refer to baptism.</p>\n      \n  <p>Baptism does appear later in the chapter, starting in verse 22, but that passage is a completely different context with different people, so it is irrelevant to the context of John 3:5.</p>\n  \n  <h4>2. The ordinance of Christian baptism had not started yet</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">Those who believe that baptism is necessary for salvation are often asked the question, "Did the thief on the cross need to be baptized to be saved? (Luke 23:43)"</p>\n  \n  <p>The usual response to this is that baptism did not become necessary for salvation until after Jesus\' death, so the thief was saved the same way believers in the Old Testament were saved, without having been baptized.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, if people did not need to be baptized before Jesus\' death, then why would Jesus say that baptism is necessary for salvation in John 3:5, before he died? The answer is that the phrase, "born of water," in this context must not be referring to baptism at all.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are two reasonable options for interpreting the phrase, "born of water," that do not involve it referring to baptism.</p>\n  \n  <h4>3. "born of water" possibly refers to natural birth</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">Some suggest that the phrase, "born of water," could refer to natural birth, saying that "water" refers to the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb and that flows from the womb right before childbirth.</p>\n  \n  <p>In this interpretation, Jesus is saying that one must be born physically, as well as spiritually, to be "born again," or to "enter the kingdom of God."</p>\n  \n  <p>However, there are two reasons to believe that this is not the best interpretation of the phrase, "born of water":</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n    <li>First, we have no example of people during this time using the phrase, "born of water," in this manner.</li>\n    <li>Second, the phrase, "born of water and the Spirit" parallel the phrase used earlier, "born again," so it is more likely that being "born of water" and "born of the Spirit" both directly relate to being "born again." Physical birth is not directly related to being "born again."</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h4>3. "born of water" likely refers to the Old Testament concept of spiritual washing or cleansing</h4>\n  \n  <p class="first">Most likely, the phrase, "born of water," refers to the Old Testament concept of water providing spiritual washing and cleansing, and the phrase, "born of the Spirit," refers to the Old Testament concept of the Spirit providing renewal and power.</p>\n  \n  <p>When Jesus uses the phrase, "born of water and the Spirit," he assumes that Nicodemus would be familiar with his language because he says later to Nicodemus, in John 3:10, "Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?" So, it is very likely that in John 3:5, Jesus is referring to Old Testament concepts (and certainly not to Christian baptism, which was not in effect yet).</p>\n  \n  <p>Here are several relevant Old Testament passages about water and the Spirit that Nicodemus would have been familiar with.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Ezekiel 36:24-27</strong></p>\n  \n  <p class="first">Ezekiel 36:24-27 is likely the specific passage Jesus had in mind when he used spoke the words in John 3:5 because it is a perfect illustration of what Jesus is talking about. This passage talks about water and the Spirit giving people new life.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Numbers 19:17-19</strong></p>\n  \n  <p class="first">In Numbers 19:17-19, water is used to cleanse an unclean person:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>17 For the unclean they shall take some ashes of the burnt sin offering, and fresh water shall be added in a vessel. 18 Then a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there and on whoever touched the bone, or the slain or the dead or the grave. 19 And the clean person shall sprinkle it on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day. Thus on the seventh day he shall cleanse him, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he shall be clean. (Numbers 19:17-19)</blockquote>\n  \n</div>',

      "<div class=\"writing\">\n  <h3>Quick answer</h3>\n  \n  <p>Adam, as the first human created and as one created without sin, likely had such an uncorrupted body and genetic constitution that he, and his descendants after him for some time, was able to live hundreds of years.</p>\n  \n  <h3>The argument</h3>\n  \n  <p>Some argue that it is completely unrealistic and impossible to believe that humans in Genesis could have lived hundreds of years. For example, Genesis teaches that Adam lived 930 years, Seth lived 912 years, and Methuselah lived 969 years:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>Thus all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died. (Genesis 5:5)</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote>Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died. (Genesis 5:8)</blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote>Thus all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died. (Genesis 5:27)</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>People today live nowhere near that long, so how could any human possibly live that long?</p>\n  \n  <h3>The answer</h3>\n  \n  <h4>A plausible explanation</h4>\n  \n  <p>We cannot know for certain exactly why or how people lived for hundreds of years in Genesis. However, there is a very plausible explanation that would answer objections that it is completely unrealistic and impossible to believe something like this.</p>\n  \n  <p>Adam was created without sin, which means that his body, including his genetics, would have been in perfect condition. It is very possible that his body would have been in such great condition that he, and his descendents after him for some time, would have been able to live for hundreds of years.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, as mankind continued to procreate, sin continued to corrupt the bodies of humans, so that they lived for shorter and shorter periods of time.</p>\n  \n  <h4>A shorter lifespan is connected with God's judgment and the flood</h4>\n  \n  <p>Humans living for a shorter period of time later in history is connected with God's judgment upon humankind for its sin, and the floor, which God uses to punish humans. In Genesis 6:3, God sees the increasing sin in humans and says this:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years. (Genesis 6:3)</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Then, immediately after this, Genesis 6:5-7 describes God responding to the sin of mankind with the flood:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the Lord said, \"I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.\"</blockquote>\n  \n  <p>So, it is possible that humans being limited to living 120 years is either the direct result of God's judgment and decree, or perhaps it is the result of something that happened through the flood. It is possible that the flood changed something in earth's environment that would cause humans to live significantly shorter lives.</p>\n  \n  <h4>We have possibilities, not certainties</h4>\n  \n  <p>Anything that the Bible does not explicitly teach is merely conjecture and not certainty. However, what is important is that there are plausible explanations that make the fact that some people lived for hundreds of years in Genesis something that is very possible to believe.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  \n  <p>There are very plausible reasons to believe that people in Genesis could have lived hundreds of years, and no reason to believe that it would have been impossible for this to happen. We can believe what the Bible teaches without compromising rationality.</p>\n</div",

      '\n <div class="writing">\n <a id="introduction"></a>\n\n <h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n <p class="first">Does your life have purpose and meaning? Or are you simply a product of random chemical processes, a miniscule and insignificant speck in a naturalistic, uncaring universe?</p>\n\n <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/GBHYcOR.png" class="image image-left" height="200" width="300"></amp-img>\n\n <p>The truth is that your life does indeed have purpose and meaning. God created the universe and humans, and He has revealed exactly why He created us.</p>\n \n <p>At the heart of why God created humans is the gospel, or the good news, of Jesus Christ. The gospel is the most important truth in the universe for every human to learn.</p>\n \n <p>Here, we will summarize the gospel, and then provide you with resources for how to continue your lifelong journey of learning more and more about the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>\n \n <p>To begin, let\'s first learn about the Bible, which is where we learn about the gospel.</p>\n\n <a id="bible"></a>\n\n <h3>Bible</h3>\n\n <p class="first">The Bible is how God has chosen to reveal Himself and His plans to humans. Throughout history, God chose to use ordinary humans to record His revelation in writings that would become the Bible that we have today. And today, these writings, preserved in the Bible, are the sole source of our knowledge of God and truth.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be <strong>complete, equipped for every good work</strong> ." (2 Timothy 3:16-17)</blockquote>\n \n <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUTxzHM.png" class="image image-right" height="171" width="300"></amp-img>\n\n <p>The Bible is all we need to be "complete, equipped for every good work." We do not need anything else besides the Bible. Neither the additional teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, nor any direct revelation or voice from God, is necessary to be saved or to please God with the life we live.</p>\n \n <p>A common term used to describe the teaching that the Bible <strong>alone</strong> is sufficient for salvation and godliness is <strong>Sola Scriptura</strong>.</p>\n \n <p>Next, we will learn what the Bible teaches us about God.</p>\n\n <a id="god"></a>\n \n <h3>God</h3>\n \n <p class="first">What has God revealed about Himself through the Bible? First, God is the <strong>creator</strong>. He created the universe, humans, and everything else in the universe.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)</blockquote>\n \n <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/SahAJm1.png" class="image image-left" height="300" width="300"></amp-img>\n\n <p>That God is creator means that He has <strong>authority</strong> over everything in the universe. He created the universe for a specific purpose, namely, <strong>for His glory</strong>.</p>\n \n <p>Second, God is <strong>holy</strong>, which means that He is <strong>set apart in His perfect righteousness</strong>.</p>\n <blockquote>"There is none holy like the Lord: for there is none besides you." (1 Samuel 2:2a)</blockquote>\n \n <p>That God is holy and perfectly righteous means that He <strong>hates evil and sin and will certainly punish it</strong>. This is bad news for us because every human being has sinned against God by not perfectly obeying His commands.</p>\n \n <p>Next, we will learn about sin, which is the problem of every human.</p>\n\n <a id="sin"></a>\n \n <h3>Sin</h3>\n \n <p class="first">Every human being is guilty of sin before God in two ways:</p>\n \n <p>First, when Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, he sinned as the <strong>representative head</strong> of the human race, and because of his sin, every human being after him is therefore also guilty of his sin, which is often called <strong>original sin</strong>.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned." (Romans 5:12)</blockquote>\n \n <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/F4M8GSw.png" class="image image-right" height="195" width="300"></amp-img>\n\n <p>Although every human is guilty of sin simply "through one man" (Adam), every human is also guilty of <strong>personal sin</strong>.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one." (Romans 3:10-12)</blockquote>\n \n <blockquote>"But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death." (Revelation 21:8)</blockquote>\n \n <p>No human being is completely innocent of the list above. All people have been cowardly, faithless, sexually immoral, idolatrous, and/or dishonest at some point in their lives.</p>\n \n <p>The punishment for our sin against God is <strong>eternal torment in hell</strong>. Suffering in hell is infinite because an offense against an infinitely holy God is <strong>infinitely serious</strong>.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name." (Revelation 14:11)</blockquote>\n \n <p>Sin is a serious problem, and we seem to be in a hopeless situation, because we have absolutely no ability to escape from our sin. But thankfully, there is a solution to sin, Jesus, whom we will learn about\n next.</p>\n\n <a id="jesus"></a>\n \n <h3>Jesus</h3>\n \n <p class="first">Jesus is both <strong>fully God</strong> and <strong>fully human</strong>. In the verses below, Jesus is "the Word."</p>\n \n <blockquote>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and <strong>the Word was God</strong> ." (John 1:1)</blockquote>\n \n <blockquote>"And <strong>the Word became flesh</strong> and dwelt among us..." (John 1:14a)</blockquote>\n \n <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/5nErEwj.png" class="image image-left" height="200" width="300"></amp-img>\n\n <p>Jesus accomplished two primary things during his life to save sinners. First, on the cross, he became a <strong>substitute sacrifice</strong> for the sins of all who would believe in him. In other words, he paid the punishment for sin in their place so that they no longer need to pay it themselves in hell. This concept of Jesus "satisfying" God\'s justice and wrath is called <strong>propitiation</strong> in the Bible.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the <strong>propitiation for our sins</strong> ." (1 John 4:10)</blockquote>\n \n <p>Second, Jesus lived a perfectly righteous life, and through faith, his perfect righteousness is <strong>imputed</strong>, or credited, to us, so that God now sees us as also being perfectly righteous. So, Jesus not only rescues us from our sin, but he also gives us a positive righteousness that enables us to have favor with God.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his <strong>faith is counted as righteousness</strong> ." (Romans 4:5)</blockquote>\n \n <p>It is important to recognize that it is <strong>Jesus\' work alone</strong> that saves us, and not Jesus\' work <strong>plus</strong> our works. We do not contribute anything to our salvation, which means that God gets all the glory for our salvation.</p>\n \n <p>Next, we will cover the role of <strong>repentance</strong> and <strong>faith</strong> in salvation.</p>\n\n <a id="salvation"></a>\n \n <h3> Salvation</h3>\n \n <p class="first">Jesus taught that to be saved, we must <strong>repent</strong> and <strong>believe</strong> the gospel.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; <strong>repent</strong> and <strong>believe</strong> in the gospel." (Mark 1:15)</blockquote>\n \n <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/ehOOkvf.png" class="image image-right" height="157" width="300"></amp-img>\n \n <p>To <strong>repent</strong> means to feel sorrow for and hatred toward your sin and to actively turn away from your sin and toward obedience to God.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation..." (2 Corinthians 7:10)</blockquote>\n \n <p>To <strong>believe</strong>, or to have <strong>faith</strong>, means to trust in Jesus\' work <strong>alone</strong> for your salvation, and not in <strong>any</strong> of your own good works.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God not a result of works, so that no one may boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9)</blockquote>\n \n <p>Although repentance and faith are actions we must take to be saved, it is God who gives us the ability to repent and have faith. God takes the initiative in giving us new life so that we can take these actions to be saved.</p>\n \n <blockquote>Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."\'(John 3:3)</blockquote>\n \n <p>If you find that you have a desire to turn from your sin towards obedience to God, and you realize that you can only be saved by believing, or trusting, in Jesus\' saving work, then you are experiencing the results of being "born again," or saved, by God. This is incredibly exciting!</p>\n \n <p>Next, we will talk about the next steps to take in your lifelong journey to learn more about the God of the Bible.</p>\n\n <a id="next"></a>\n \n <h3>Next Steps</h3>\n \n <p class="first">The most important thing to do as one who believes in Jesus is to <strong>continue learning about and obeying the Bible</strong>. Being a Christian is a lifelong journey and not merely a one-time decision or prayer.</p>\n \n <blockquote>"And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent." (John 17:3)</blockquote>\n \n <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/0aerGX6.png" class="image image-left" height="169" width="300"></amp-img>\n\n <p>Eternal life, or heaven, is about "knowing" God, which means that there is no end to this endeavor. Visit the "Resources" page below for a list of great resources to continue learning about God through the Bible.</p>\n \n <p><a href="/resources/learn" class="link">Resources: Learn</a></p>\n \n <p>In addition to continuing to learn about the Bible, you should find a solid church where you can fellowship and share life with other believers. The Bible is clear that we should be regularly meeting with other believers:</p>\n \n <blockquote>"And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near." (Hebrews 10:24-25)</blockquote>\n \n <p>Visit the Church Finder page for a list of church finders/directories that you can use to find a solid church:</p>\n \n <p><a href="/resources/church-finders" class="link">Resources: Church Finders</a></p>\n </div>\n',

If the book of John was written in the first half of the second century, then that means that the other gospels would have been written even earlier than that. This manuscript gives us greater confidence in the reliable transmission of the Bible throughout history.</p>\n</div>',
