  <h3>Quick answer</h3>

  <p>This discrepancy is likely the result of a copyist error, where 1 Chronicles 19:8 (7,000) is probably the correct number. The doctrine of the Bible's inerrancy states that the <strong>original manuscripts</strong> are without error and we can have great confidence that the Bible that we have today is <strong>essentially</strong> a copy of the original writings, not that <strong>everything</strong> has been copied perfectly, so this apparent contradiction is not a problem for biblical inerrancy.</p>

  <h3>The argument</h3>

  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning how many charioteers were killed, whether it was 700 or 7,000 charioteers. Here are the relevant passages:</p>

  <h4>700 charioteers</h4>

  <blockquote><strong>2 Samuel 10:18</strong> - And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians <strong>the men of 700 chariots</strong>, and 40,000 horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there.</blockquote>

  <h4>7,000 charioteers</h4>

  <blockquote><strong>1 Chronicles 19:18</strong> - And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians <strong>the men of 7,000 chariots</strong> and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death also Shophach the commander of their army.</blockquote>

  <h3>The answer</h3>

  <h4>Probably a copyist error</h4>

  <p>This discrepancy is likely the result of a copyist error. The correct number is probably 7,000, from 1 Chronicles 19:18.</p>

  <p>In our numeral system, 700 and 7,000 differ by only one zero, and it would be very easy to accidentally write one number when we meant the other.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the difference between 700 and 7,000 in the Hebrew language is extremely small, and so it should not be surprising that a copyist could have made an error like this.</p>

  <h4>This is not a problem for biblical infallibility and inerrancy</h4>

  <p>The doctrine of the Bible's inerrancy states that the <strong>original manuscripts</strong> are without error and we can have great confidence that the Bible that we have today is <strong>essentially</strong> a copy of the original writings, not that <strong>everything</strong> has been copied perfectly, so this apparent contradiction is not a problem for biblical inerrancy.</p>
