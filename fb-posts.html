  <h3>Quick answer</h3>

  <p>Jeremiah 7:22 is referring to one specific day, the day that He brought the Israelites out of Egypt. In Exodus 20:24, God is speaking about sacrifices at Mount Sinai, three months after "the day" that He brought the Israelites out of Egypt.</p>

  <h3>The argument</h3>

  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether God spoke about sacrifices at the Exodus. Exodus 20:24 says that He did, while Jeremiah 7:22 says that He did not. Here are the relevant passages:</p>

  <h4>God spoke about sacrifices</h4>

  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 20:24</strong> - An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you.</blockquote>

  <h4>God did not speak about sacrifices</h4>

  <blockquote><strong>Jeremiah 7:22</strong> - For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.</blockquote>

  <h3>The answer</h3>

  <p>There is no contradiction because Jeremiah 7:22 is referring to "the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt," which is one specific day. On this day, God did not speak to the Israelites about burnt offerings or sacrifices.</p>

  <p>In Exodus 20:24, God is speaking to the Israelites from Mount Sinai, which the Israelites reached three months after "the day" that God brought them out of Egypt.</p>

  <p>So, God did not speak to the Israelites about burnth offerings or sacrifices on "the day" that He brought them out of Egypt, but He did speak about them three months later, at Mount Sinai.</p>
