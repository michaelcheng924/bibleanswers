  <h3>Quick answer</h3>

  <p>The Bible's definition of "chews the cud" is simply different from the technical definition we are thinking of. When the Bible says that the rabbit (or hare) and rock badger "chew the cud," it is simply saying that they make a chewing motion that looks like what other animals do when they "chew the cud." There is nothing wrong here because the Bible sometimes speaks generically and does not claim to be a technical or scientific textbook.</p>

  <h3>The argument</h3>

  <p>Some argue that the Bible is incorrect when it says that the rabbit/hare and rock badger "chew the cud," and so it cannot be infallible or inerrant. Here is the relevant passage:</p>

  <blockquote><strong>Leviticus 11:5-6</strong> - 5 And the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. 6 And the hare, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.</blockquote>

  <h3>The answer</h3>

  <h4>The Bible's definition of "chew the cud" is not our technical one</h4>

  <h4>According to Norman Geisler:</h4>

  <p>Here is what Norman Geisler says about this topic:</p>

  <blockquote>It is known that rabbits practice what is called "refection," in which indigestible vegetable matter contains certain bacteria and is passed as droppings and then eaten again. This process enables the rabbit to better digest it. This process is very similar to rumination, and it gives the impression of chewing the cud. So, the Hebrew phrase "chewing the cud" should not be taken in the modern technical sense, but in the ancient sense of a chewing motion that includes both rumination and refection in the modern sense.[1]</blockquote>
