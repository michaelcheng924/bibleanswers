  <h3>Quick answer</h3>
  
  <p>We should not attribute to anyone authority that only belongs to God. There is a difference between calling our earthly parent "father" and giving excessive reverence to a spiritual leader.</p>

  <h3>The argument</h3>

  <p>Some argue that the Bible is contradictory concerning whether we should call anyone "father." Exodus 20:12 says that we should, yet Matthew 23:8-10 appears to say that we should not. Here are the relevant passages:</p>

  <h4>Call someone "father"</h4>

  <blockquote><strong>Exodus 20:12</strong> - "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you."</blockquote>

  <h4>Call no one "father"</h4>

  <blockquote><strong>Matthew 23:8-10</strong> - 8 But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. 9 And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. 10 Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ.</blockquote>

  <h3>The answer</h3>

  <p>The use of the word "father" is different between Exodus 20:12 and Matthew 23:8-10. In Exodus 20:12, "father" is simply used to refer to a parent, whereas in Matthew 23:8-10, "father" is used to refer to a person who is being put in the place of God the Father.</p>

  <p>We are not to view any person on earth as having the kind of authority that God has. This is what Matthew 23:8-10 is talking about, not that we cannot call <strong>anyone</strong> father.</p>

  <p>Matthew 23:8-10 is saying that we only have one heavenly Father, so we should not treat any man on earth, whether parent or spiritual leader, as if he possessed the authority that should only belong to God.</p>

  <p>Practically speaking, it can be tempting to give greater authority than is appropriate to an earthly father or to a spiritual leader. This is what Matthew 23:8-10 is warning against.</p>
