  <h3>The two types of agnosticism</h3>

  <p class="first">There are two types of agnosticism, one of which is inherently self-contradictory.</p>

  <p />
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Truth cannot be known.</strong> This position is self-contradictory.</li>
    <li><strong>I simply do not know the truth.</strong> This position is not self-contradictory because it does not make any universal assertion. However, instead of being satisfied with not knowing the truth, one who holds this position <strong>should</strong> have a desire to pursue the truth.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here, we will examine why the first position, that "Truth cannot be known," is an impossibly self-contradictory position.</p>

  <h3>The assertion, "Truth cannot be known" is self-contradictory</h3>

  <p>In short, "truth cannot be known" is a self-contradictory position because if truth cannot be known, then the supposed "truth," "truth cannot be known," <strong>cannot itself be known</strong>.</p>

  <p>If it is true that "truth cannot be known," then it is also true that "truth" <strong>can</strong> be known, since "truth" that "truth cannot be known" can be known. However, if truth <strong>both can and can't</strong> be known at the same time, then truth is self-contradictory, which is impossible.</p>
  
  <p>If truth both can and can't be known at the same time, then any statement could also be both true and untrue at the same time, which is absurd. No statement at all would have any meaning whatsoever.</p>

  <p>The necessary conclusion to all of this is that the position, "Truth cannot be known," cannot be true because it is impossibly self-contradictory.</p>
