    <h3>The alleged contradiction</h3>

    <p class="first">At first glace, the genealogies of Matthew and Luke appear to be contradictory. Matthew's genealogy traces Jesus back through David's son Solomon, and Luke's genealogy traces Jesus back through David's son Nathan. Also, Matthew states that Joseph's father is Jacob, and Luke states that Joseph's father is Heli.</p>

    <blockquote>And <strong>David was the father of Solomon</strong> by the wife of Uriah... (Matthew 1:6)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>and <strong>Jacob the father of Joseph</strong> the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. (Matthew 1:16)</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote> Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of <strong>Joseph, the son of Heli</strong>... (Luke 3:23)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of <strong>Nathan, the son of David</strong>... (Luke 3:31)</blockquote>

    <h3>Several possible explanations for the apparent contradiction</h3>

    <p class="first">The seeming discrepancies between Matthew and Luke's genealogies are definitely not certain contradictions. There are several good reasons to believe that there is no contradiction between the two authors.</p>

    <h4>Matthew and Luke clearly have different objectives with their genealogies</h4>

    <p class="first">The most significant factor to consider is that it is clear that Matthew and Luke are not trying to accomplish the same things with their genealogies. Here are some significant differences:</p>

    <p></p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Matthew begins his genealogy with Abraham, which suggests he is writing to a primarily Jewish audience, whereas Luke begins his genealogy with Adam, which suggests a broader audience that includes Gentiles.</li>
      <li>Matthew's genealogy occurs at the very beginning, whereas Luke's genealogy occurs later in the book, after Mary has been introduced, which makes it possible that Luke is actually tracing Jesus back through Mary, instead of Joseph.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The fact that Matthew and Luke's genealogies clearly have different purposes and themes helps us approach the differences between them with the question, "<strong>Why</strong> are they different?", rather than with the declaration, "They are contradictory."</p>

    <h4>Luke's genealogy may be of Mary's</h4>

    <p class="first">One possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy between the two genealogies is that Matthew's genealogy is of Joseph's, while Luke's genealogy is of Mary's. There was no Greek word for "son-in-law," so perhaps Joseph was the "son of Heli" in the sense that he was married to Mary, Heli's daughter. Then, Joseph would have descended from David's son Solomon, while Mary would have descended from David's son Nathan.</p>

    <p>Although it would have been unusual to trace a genealogy through a mother's side (Mary's side), Mary was an extraordinary woman. Furthermore, Luke's genealogy does not occur until later in the book, after Luke has introduced Mary and told part of the story from her point of view.</p>

    <h4>Eusebius's explanation</h4>

    <p class="first">Another possible explanation, which was held by the church historian Eusebius, is that Matthew's genealogy is a biological genealogy, while Luke's genealogy is legal genealogy. In Jewish tradition, if a man died without having any sons, his brother would marry the widow and have a son who could carry on the family name. Eusebius noted that Melchi (Luke 3:24) and Matthan (Matthew 1:15) were both married to the same woman at different times, which would make Heli (Luke 3:23) and Jacob (Matthew 1:15) half-brothers.</p>

    <p>Then, perhaps, when Heli died without a son, his half-brother Jacob married Heli's widow. This would mean that Joseph is <em>legally</em> the son of Heli, but <em>biologically</em> the son of Jacob. Then, Jacob would be the descendent of Solomon, and Heli would be the descendent of Nathan.</p>

    <h4>We should give Matthew and Luke the benefit of the doubt</h4>

    <p class="first">Because of all of the factors listed above, we should assume that Matthew and Luke would not write genealogies that are so directly contradictory. It is likely that they would have been able to double-check their facts, especially because genealogies were extremely important to the Jews. Furthermore, it is likely they used similar sources, and perhaps even communicated with one another, before writing their genealogies, in which case it would be silly to believe that they would write contradictory genealogies.</p>
