    <h3>Who is Lucian of Samosata?</h3>

    <p class="first">Lucian of Samosata was a Greek satirist during the second half of the second century. Lucian had contempt for Jesus and Christians and wrote with the assumption that Jesus existed.</p>

    <h3>What did Lucian write?</h3>

    <p class="first">Lucian wrote the following:</p>

    <blockquote>The Christians, you know, <strong>worship a man to this dayâ€”-the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account</strong>... You see, these misguided creatures start with the general conviction that they are immortal for all time, which explains the contempt of death and voluntary self-devotion which are so common among them; and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and <strong>worship the crucified sage</strong>, and live after his laws. All this they take quite on faith, with the result that they despise all worldly goods alike, regarding them merely as common property.</blockquote>

    <p>There are three things of particular note in this passage:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Lucian is a trustworthy source because he is hostile to Christianity</li>
      <li>The "man" whom Christians worship clearly refers to Jesus. Even though Jesus is not mentioned by name, Jesus is the only person who would fit this description.</li>
      <li>Lucian corroborates the Bible's teaching that Jesus was crucified</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This passage from Lucian's writings is strong evidence that Jesus not only existed, but was also crucified.</p>
