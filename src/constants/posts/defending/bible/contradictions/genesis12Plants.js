    <h3>The alleged problem</h3>

    <p class="first">Supposedly, Genesis 1 and 2 are contradictory concerning when plants were created.</p>

    <h4>Genesis 1:11-13</h4>

    <blockquote class="first">And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, <strong>the third day</strong>.</blockquote>

    <h4>Genesis 1:26-31</h4>

    <blockquote class="first">Then God said, “Let us make man"... And there was evening and there was morning, <strong>the sixth day</strong>.</blockquote>

    <h4>Genesis 2:5-9</h4>

    <blockquote class="first">When <strong>no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up</strong>—-for the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground, and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground—-<strong>then the Lord God formed the man of dust</strong> from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. <strong>And the Lord God planted a garden</strong> in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. And <strong>out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree</strong> that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</blockquote>

    <p>From these passages, it seems that in Genesis 1, plants are created <strong>before</strong> man, and in Genesis 2, plants are created <strong>after</strong> man. Two solutions have been proposed for this apparent contradiction, one of which is problematic and the other of which is the better solution.</p>

    <h3>The better solution</h3>

    <p class="first">The key to this solution is recognizing the <strong>difference</strong> between the plants in Genesis 1 and the plants in Genesis 2. In Genesis 2, we see the key words <strong>of the field</strong>, which do not show up in Genesis 1.</p>

    <blockquote>When no bush <strong>of the field</strong> was yet in the land and no small plant <strong>of the field</strong> had yet sprung up...</blockquote>

    <img src="http://bibleanswers.io/static/images/garden.png" class="image-left">

    <p>The key difference between the plants in Genesis 1 and the plants in Genesis 2 is that the plants in Genesis 2 are <strong>plants that are cared for by humans, or plants in a garden</strong>. Before humans were created, there would be no gardeners or gardens, so obviously these kinds of plants (plants <strong>of the field</strong>) would not be in existence yet.</p>

    <p>Genesis 2 is not saying that wild vegetation did not exist before man was created, but rather that plants cared for by man did not exist before man was created. We can imply that while plants <strong>of the field</strong> were not created before man, wild vegetation indeed were created before man.</p>

    <p>Since the same author wrote Genesis 1 and 2, we should assume that this author would not write such an obvious contradiction, and indeed, we find a very clear solution to the alleged contradiction.</p>

    <h3>The problematic solution</h3>

    <p class="first">Some people try to solve this problem by saying that the creation account in Genesis is not a genre that we should take literally or as historical. They might say that it is poetry, or that it is a "creation narrative" that has different rules for interpretation than a historical narrative.</p>

    <p>The problem with this attempted solution is that the creation account in Genesis flows directly into what is clearly historical narrative, and it is unlikely that there is such a division between the genre of the earlier chapters of Genesis and the genre of the later chapters.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this attempted solution causes us to lose faith in the Bible. If the creation account in Genesis can be considered contradictory and thus not to be taken literally, then this will start to chip away at our confidence in other parts of the Bible.</p>

    <p>The better solution presented above makes complete sense, so it should be strongly preferred over the problematic solution that was just presented.</p>
