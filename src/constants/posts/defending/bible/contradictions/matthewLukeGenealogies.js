    <h3>The alleged contradiction</h3>

    <p class="first">At first glace, the genealogies of Matthew and Luke appear to be contradictory. Matthew's genealogy traces Jesus back through David's son Solomon, and Luke's genealogy traces Jesus back through David's son Nathan. Also, Matthew states that Joseph's father is Jacob, and Luke states that Joseph's father is Heli.</p>

    <blockquote>And <strong>David was the father of Solomon</strong> by the wife of Uriah... (Matthew 1:6)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>and <strong>Jacob the father of Joseph</strong> the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. (Matthew 1:16)</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote> Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of <strong>Joseph, the son of Heli</strong>... (Luke 3:23)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of <strong>Nathan, the son of David</strong>... (Luke 3:31)</blockquote>

    <h3>Several possible explanations for the apparent contradiction</h3>

    <p class="first">The seeming discrepancies between Matthew and Luke's genealogies are definitely not certain contradictions. There are several good reasons to believe that there is no contradiction between the two authors.</p>

    <h4>Matthew and Luke clearly have different objectives with their genealogies</h4>

    <p class="first">The most significant factor to consider is that it is clear that Matthew and Luke are not trying to accomplish the same things with their genealogies. Here are some significant differences:</p>

    <p></p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Matthew begins his genealogy with Abraham, which suggests he is writing to a primarily Jewish audience, whereas Luke begins his genealogy with Adam, which suggests a broader audience that includes Gentiles.</li>
      <li>Matthew's genealogy occurs at the very beginning, whereas Luke's genealogy occurs later in the book, after Mary has been introduced, which makes it possible that Luke is actually tracing Jesus back through Mary, instead of Joseph.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The fact that Matthew and Luke's genealogies clearly have different purposes and themes helps us approach the differences between them with the question, "Why are they different?", rather than with the declaration, "They are contradictory."</p>
