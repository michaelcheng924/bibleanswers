 <h3>Harmonizing the gospel resurrection accounts</h3>

 <h3>1. Early in the morning, at least five women went to Jesus' tomb</h3>

 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">John 20:1-29 | v1a</p>

 <span class="scripture-verse">1a</span> Now on the first day of the week <a href="#how-many-women"><span class="red">Mary Magdalene</span></a> came to the tomb early, <a href="#when-women-go"><span class="purple">while it was still dark</span></a>,
 </p>
 </div>
 </div>

 <h4>
 <a id="when-women-go" href="#when-women-go-s"><span class="purple">When did the women go to the tomb?</span></a>
 </h4>
 <p class="first">Two possibilities:</p>

 <p></p>
 
 <ol>
 <li>The sky was still mostly dark, with the sun just starting to rise</li>
 <li>The sky was still dark when the women left Bethany (John), and it was dawn and the sun had risen when they reached the tomb (Matthew, Mark, and Luke)</li>
 </ol>

 <h4>
 <a id="how-many-women" href="#how-many-women-s"><span class="red"><strong>How many women went to the tomb?</strong></span></a>
 </h4>
 <p class="first">
 At least five women went to the tomb. Luke 24:10 says that "Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women" were at the tomb, which is at least five women. The other gospels do not say that <em>only</em> the two Marys, <em>only</em> the two Marys and Salome, or <em>only</em> Mary Magdalene went to the tomb, so there is no contradiction. In fact, in John, Mary Magdalene says to Peter and John, "...<strong>we</strong> do not know where they have laid him..." It is reasonable to believe that the other authors simply didn't list out all the women who went to the tomb, for various reasons.
 </p>

 <h3>2. Before the women arrived at the tomb, there was an earthquake and an angel rolled away the stone</h3>

 <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Matthew 28:1-10 | v2-4</p>
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">2</span> And behold, <a href="#earthquake" id="earthquake-s"><span class="teal">there was a great earthquake</span></a>, for <a href="#how-many-angels"><span class="orange"></a>an angel</span> of the Lord descended from heaven and came and <a href="#stone-rolled-away" id="stone-rolled-away-s"><span class="blue">rolled back the stone</span></a> and <a href="#standing-sitting" id="standing-sitting-s"><span class="indigo">sat</span></a> <a href="#where-angels" id="where-angels-s"><span class="pink">on it</span></a>. <span class="scripture-verse">3</span> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. <span class="scripture-verse">4</span> And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.
 </p>
 </div>
 </div>

 <h4 class="teal">
 <a href="#earthquake-s" id="earthquake">
 <span class="teal">Why is the earthquake only recorded in Matthew?</span>
 </a>
 </h4>

 <p class="first">The earthquake occurred <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb. Matthew's account helps explain how the stone was rolled away and why there were no guards. The other authors simply leave out these additional details.</p>

 <h3>3. The women arrived at the tomb and saw that the stoned was rolled away</h3>

 <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Mark 16:1-8 | v3-4</p>
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">3</span> And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?" <span class="scripture-verse">4</span> And looking up, <a href="#stone-rolled-away"><span class="blue">they saw that the stone had been rolled back</span></a>&mdash;it was very large.
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v2</p> 
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">2</span> And <a href="#stone-rolled-away"><span class="blue">they found the stone rolled away from the tomb</span></a>,
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">John 20:1-29 | v1b</p> 
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">1b</span> and <a href="#stone-rolled-away"><span class="blue">saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb</span></a>.
 </p>
 </div>
 </div>

 <h4>
 <a href="#stone-rolled-away-s" id="stone-rolled-away">
 <span class="blue">Was the stone rolled away before or after the women arrived at the tomb?</span>
 </a>
 </h4>

 <p class="first">As explained above, the stone was rolled away before the women arrived at the tomb. The events of <span class="scripture">Matthew 28:2-4</span> occurred <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb.</p>

 <h3>4. Upon seeing the stone rolled away, Mary Magdalene separated from the other women to go tell Peter and John, who were not staying at Bethany with the other disciples</h3>

 <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">John 20:1-29 | v2</p> 
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">2</span> So she ran and <a href="#peter-john" id="peter-john-s"><span class="orange-1">went to Simon Peter and the other disciple</span></a>, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and <a href="#how-many-women"><span class="red">we</span></a> do not know where they have laid him."
 </p>
 </div>
 </div>

 <h4><a href="#peter-john-s" id="peter-john"><span class="orange-1">Were Peter and John with the other disciples?</span></a></h4>

 <p class="first">Peter and John were likely not staying with the other disciples. We know that although all the disciples fled, Peter and John were brave enough to follow Jesus into Jerusalem (<span class="scripture">John 18:15</span>). John was also present at the cross (<span class="scripture">John 19:26</span>). It is likely that Peter and John met up at some point and stayed in Jerusalem, while the rest of the disciples were staying in Bethany.</p>

 <h3>5. The women (except Mary Magdalene) meet angels inside the tomb</h3>

 <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Matthew 28:1-10 | v5-7</p>
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">5</span> But <a href="#how-many-angels" id="how-many-angels-s"><span class="orange">the angel</span></a> said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. <span class="scripture-verse">6</span> He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. <span class="scripture-verse">7</span> Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you."
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Mark 16:1-8 | v5-7</p>
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">5</span> And <a href="#where-angels"><span class="pink">entering the tomb, they saw</span></a> <a href="#how-many-angels"><span class="orange">a young man</span></a> <a href="#standing-sitting"><span class="indigo">sitting</span></a> on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. <span class="scripture-verse">6</span> And he said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. <span class="scripture-verse">7</span> But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you."
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v3-7</p> 
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">3</span> but when <a href="#where-angels"><span class="pink">they went in</span></a> they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <span class="scripture-verse">4</span> While they were perplexed about this, behold, <a href="#how-many-angels"><span class="orange">two men</span></a> <a href="#standing-sitting"><span class="indigo">stood</span></a> by them in dazzling apparel. <span class="scripture-verse">5</span> And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? <span class="scripture-verse">6</span> He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, <span class="scripture-verse">7</span> that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.”
 </p>
 </div>
 </div>

 <h4><a href="#how-many-angels-s" id="how-many-angels"><span class="orange">How many angels did the women see? Did the women see angels or men?</span></a></h4>

 <p class="first">The women saw two angels at the tomb. Matthew does not say that there was <em>only</em> one angel, and Mark does not say that there was <em>only</em> one man. Perhaps they simply felt that they did not need to emphasize that there were two angels, or two men.</p>

 <p>Regarding whether the women saw angels or men, angels oftentime appeared in the form of men (<span class="scripture">Genesis 18:1–2</span>; <span class="scripture">Daniel 9:21</span>. So, it is reasonable to believe that the women saw angels who looked like men.</p>

 <h4><a href="#where-angels-s" id="where-angels"><span class="pink">Were the angels inside the tomb or sitting on the stone?</span></a></h4>

 <p class="first">As explained above, the events of <span class="scripture">Matthew 28:2-4</span> occurred <strong>before</strong> the women arrived at the tomb. The angel in Matthew was on top of the stone when the guards saw him and fainted/fled, and then actually met the women inside the tomb. Mark, Luke, and John all record the angels meeting the women inside the tomb using slightly different, but not contradictory, language.</p>

 <h4><a href="#standing-sitting-s" id="standing-sitting"><span class="indigo">Were the angels standing or sitting when the women met them?</span></a></h4>

 <p class="first">The angels were probably sitting when the women saw them, and then they stood up immediately afterwards. When Luke says that the angels "stood" (<span class="scripture">Luke 24:4</span>), he could be referred to an action that they did at that moment, rather than what they had already done.</p>

 <h3>6. The women (except Mary Magdalene) left the tomb to go tell the disciples (except Peter and John), who were in Bethany, about the empty tomb</h3>

 <h4><a href="#who-women-tell-s" id="who-women-tell"><span class="cyan">Did the women (except Mary Magdalene) tell the disciples about the empty tomb?</span></a></h4>

 <p class="first">It is reasonable to believe that at first the women didn't say anything to anyone because they were afraid, and then after they overcame this fear, they remembered the angels' words and told the disciples. <span class="scripture">Luke 24:8</span> says specifically that the women "remembered his words," which could imply that they at first told nobody, but decided to tell the disciples after they remembered what the angels had said to them.</p>

 <p>We know that Thomas was not with the other disciples at first (<span class="scripture">John 20:24</span>), so he was told about the events later.</p>

 <span class="scripture-verse">11</span> But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. <span class="scripture-verse">12</span> And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. <span class="scripture-verse">13</span> They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him." <span class="scripture-verse">14</span> Having said this, <a href="#jesus-appearance"><span class="green">she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus</span></a>. <span class="scripture-verse">15</span> Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?

She turned and said to him in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher). <span class="scripture-verse">17</span> Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’" <span class="scripture-verse">18</span> Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord"—and that he had said these things to her.
 </p>
 </div>
 </div>

 <h4><a href="#jesus-appearance-s" id="jesus-appearance"><span class="green">Did Jesus appear first to a group of women, or to Mary Magdalene alone?</span></a></h4>

 <p class="first">Jesus either appeared first to Mary Magdalene at the tomb, and then to the group of women while they were on their way to Bethany to tell the disciples, or vice versa. It is reasonable to believe that Mark and Luke do not mention either of these appearances because they've already included spectacular events that have happened this day, and their specific narrative of events did not require mentioning these appearances.</p>

 <h3>9. The other women (except Mary Magdalene) tell the other disciples in Bethany about the empty tomb</h3>

 <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v8-12</p> 
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">8</span> And they remembered his words, <span class="scripture-verse">9</span> and returning from the tomb <a href="#who-women-tell"><span class="cyan">they told all these things</span></a> <a href="#who-tell" id="who-tell-s"><span class="brown">to the eleven and to all the rest</span></a>. <span class="scripture-verse">10</span> <a href="#who-tell"><span class="brown">Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles</span></a>, <span class="scripture-verse">11</span> but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. <span class="scripture-verse">12</span> But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.
 </p>
 </div>
 </div>

 <h4><a href="#who-tell-s" id="who-tell"><span class="brown">Were all the women and all the disciples together when the news about the empty tomb was told?</span></a></h4>

 <p class="first">Probably not. It is likely that Mary Magdalene had separated from the rest of the women to tell Peter and John, who were staying at a different place than the rest of the disciples. The rest of the women (except Mary Magdalene) told the rest of the disciples, and they may have either made an extra stop, or split up, to tell Cleopas and an unnamed disciple about the day's events also (<span class="scripture">Luke 24:13-24</span>)</p>

 <h3>10. Jesus' third appearance was to Cleopas and his companion</h3>

 <div class="resurrection-scripture-container">
 <div class="resurrection-scripture">
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-title">Luke 24:1-44 | v13-32</p>
 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">13</span> That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, <span class="scripture-verse">14</span> and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. <span class="scripture-verse">15</span> While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. <span class="scripture-verse">16</span> But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <span class="scripture-verse">17</span> And he said to them, "What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?" And they stood still, looking sad. <span class="scripture-verse">18</span> Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?" <span class="scripture-verse">19</span> And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <span class="scripture-verse">20</span> and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <span class="scripture-verse">21</span> But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <span class="scripture-verse">22</span> Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, <span class="scripture-verse">23</span> and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <span class="scripture-verse">24</span> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see." <span class="scripture-verse">25</span> And he said to them, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! <span class="scripture-verse">26</span> Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?" <span class="scripture-verse">27</span> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.

 <span class="scripture-verse">28</span> So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, <span class="scripture-verse">29</span> but they urged him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them. <span class="scripture-verse">30</span> When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. <span class="scripture-verse">31</span> And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. <span class="scripture-verse">32</span> They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"

 <span class="scripture-verse">36</span> As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace to you!” <span class="scripture-verse">37</span> But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. <span class="scripture-verse">38</span> And he said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? <span class="scripture-verse">39</span> See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have." <span class="scripture-verse">40</span> And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. <span class="scripture-verse">41</span> And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?" <span class="scripture-verse">42</span> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <span class="scripture-verse">43</span> and he took it and ate before them.

 <span class="scripture-verse">44</span> Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."

 <p class="nomargin resurrection-scripture-text">
 <span class="scripture-verse">24</span> Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin,[d] was not with them when Jesus came. <span class="scripture-verse">25</span> So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord."

 <span class="scripture-verse">26</span> Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you." <span class="scripture-verse">27</span> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe." <span class="scripture-verse">28</span> Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!" <span class="scripture-verse">29</span> Jesus said to him, "Have you believed because you have seen me?

 <h3>General notes concerning harmonizing the resurrection accounts</h3>

 <h4>The differences between the gospels point to their authenticity</h4>

 <p class="first">What would actually be <em>more</em> suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.</p>

 <p>However, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself. So, rather than producing doubt, the differences between the gospel accounts should actually make us more confident in the historicity of the resurrection accounts.</p>
 
 <h4>It is perfectly normal for eyewitness accounts to differ</h4>
 
 <p class="first">Not every witness to an event recalls all of the details perfectly, or in the exact same way, so we should expect various accounts of the resurrection events to differ from one another.</p>
 
 <h4>The key is that there are no irreconcilable contradictions</h4>
 
 <p class="first">As long as we can provide <strong>possibilities</strong> for how the various resurrection accounts could reconcile into one coherent narrative, then there would be no irreconcilable, or necessary contradiction. This would then allow us to continue believing in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible without any compromise.</p>
 
 <h4>"But, I'm not convinced by your explanations. I still think these are irreconcilable contradictions."</h4>
 
 <p class="first">It's likely that non-believers won't accept the possible explanations that we provide concerning reconciling the apparent contradictions in the resurrection narratives. However, their refusal to accept these explanations is not based upon the fact that reasonable and possible explanations have been provided, but simply upon the fact that they don't <strong>want</strong> to believe that there are legitimately reasonable and possible explanations.</p>
 
 <p>Their goal is simply to continue justifying their unbelief in the Bible, regardless of any fact or explanation provided to them. So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do. We should inform them that they are being unreasonable and stubborn, and that they are simply trying to shut their minds to the truth.</p>
