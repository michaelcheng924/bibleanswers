 <h3>What are the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion?</h3>
 
 <p class="first">The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion define the doctrines and practices of the Church of England regarding the controversies of the English Reformation. They were finalized in 1571. These articles were written when Calvinist doctrine reached its greatest influence in the Church of England.</p>
 
 <h3>The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion</h3>
 <p class="first">
 <strong>THE ARTICLES OF RELIGION</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Agreed upon by the Archbishops, Bishops, and the whole clergy of the
 Provinces of Canterbury and York, London, 1562.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or
 passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and
 Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this
 Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the
 Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>II. Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the
 Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father,
 took Man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so
 that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and
 Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof
 is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, war crucified,
 dead and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not
 only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>III. Of the going down of Christ into Hell</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 As Christ died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed, that
 he went down into Hell.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>IV. Of the Resurrection of Christ</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with
 flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man's
 nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he
 return to judge all Men at the last day.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>V. Of the Holy Ghost</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one
 substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and
 eternal God.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>VI. Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for salvation</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that
 whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be
 required of any man, that it should be. believed as an article of the
 Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of
 the Holy Scripture we do understand those Canonical Books of the Old and
 New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong><em>Of the Names and Numbers of the Canonical Books</em></strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">Genesis</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Exodus</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Leviticus</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Numbers</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Deuteronomy</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Joshua</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Judges</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Ruth</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The First Book of Samuel</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Second Book of Samuel</p>

 <p class="nomargin">The Book of Job</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Psalms</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Proverbs</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Ecclesiastes or Preacher</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Cantica or Songs of Solomon</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Four Prophets the greater</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Twelve Prophets the less</p>
 <p>
 <strong><em>
 And the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example
 of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to
 establish any doctrine; such are these following:
 </em></strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">The Third Book of Kings</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Fourth Book of Kings</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Book of Tobias</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Book of Judith</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The rest of the Book of Esther</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Book of Wisdom</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Jesus the Son of Sirach</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Baruch the Prophet</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Song of the Three Children</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Story of Susanna</p>
 <p class="nomargin">Of Bel and the Dragon</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Prayer of Manasses</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The First Book of Maccabees</p>
 <p class="nomargin">The Second Book of Maccabees</p>
 <p>
 All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do
 receive, and account them Canonical.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>VII. Of the Old Testament</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New
 Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the
 only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they
 are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for
 transitory promises. Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching
 Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts
 thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet
 notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of
 the Commandments which are called Moral.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>VIII. Of the Three Creeds</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that which is
 commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and
 believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy
 Scripture.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>IX. Of Original or Birth-sin</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Original Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do
 vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the mature of every
 man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is
 very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature
 inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit;
 and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's
 wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature Both remain, yea in them
 that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek,
 phronema sarkos, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some
 the affection some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of
 God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are
 baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath
 of itself the nature of sin.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>X. Of Free Will</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such that he cannot turn
 and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith,
 and calling upon God: Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant
 and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us,
 that we may have a ,good will, and working with us, when we have that good
 will.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XI. Of the justification of Adam</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and
 Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings:
 Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only is a most wholesome
 Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the
 Homily of Justification.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XII. Of Good Works</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after
 Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God's
 judgement; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do
 spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; insomuch that by them a
 lively, Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XIII. Of Works before Justification</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit,
 are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus
 Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the
 School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that they
 are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt
 not but they have the nature of sin.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XIV. Of Works of Supererogation</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God's Commandments, which they
 call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogant' and
 impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God
 as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake, than
 of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have
 done all that arc commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XV. Of Christ alone without Sin</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin
 only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his
 spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself
 once made, should take away the sins of the world, and sin, as Saint ,John
 saith, was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized, and born
 again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin,
 we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XVI. Of Sin after Baptism</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the
 Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to
 be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received
 the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by
 the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives. And therefore
 they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they
 live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XVII. Of Predestination and Election</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before
 the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his
 counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he
 hath chosen in Christ out of mankind. and to bring them by Christ to
 everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which be
 endued with so excellent a benefit of God be called according to God's
 purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the
 calling: they be justified freely: then be made sons of God by adoption:
 they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son ,Jesus Christ: they
 walk religiously in good works, and at length, by God's mercy, they attain
 to everlasting felicity.
 </p>
 <p>
 As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ,
 is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and
 such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying
 the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their
 mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly
 establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed
 through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards
 God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to
 have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's Predestination,
 is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either
 into desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less
 perilous than desperation.
 </p>
 <p>
 Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be
 generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will
 of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the
 Word of God.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XVIII. Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall
 be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to
 frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature. For Holy
 Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men
 must be saved.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XIX. Of the Church</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in the
 which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be
 dulyministered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of
 necessity are requisite to the same.
 </p>
 <p>
 As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also
 the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of
 Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XX. Of the Authority of the Church</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authorityin
 Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain
 any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so
 expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.
 Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ, as
 it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same
 ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of
 Salvation.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXI. Of the Authority of General Councils</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 General Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and
 will of Princes. And when they be gathered together, (forasmuch as they be
 an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word
 of God,) they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining
 unto God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have
 neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be
 taken out of Holy Scripture.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXII. Of Purgatory</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and
 Adoration, as well of Images as of Reliques, and also invocation of
 Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of
 Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXIII. Of Ministering in the Congregation</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of publick
 preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be
 lawfully called, and sent to execute the same. And those we ought to judge
 lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men
 who have publick authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call
 and send Ministers into the Lord's vineyard.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>
 XXIV. Of speaking in the Congregation in such a tongue as the people
 understandeth
 </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the
 Primitive Church, to have publick Prayer in the Church, or to minister the
 Sacraments in a tongue not understanded of the people.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXV. Of the Sacraments</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian
 men's profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual
 signs of grace, and God's good will towards us, by the which he doth work
 invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and
 confirm our Faith in him.
 </p>
 <p>
 There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that
 is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
 Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,
 Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for
 Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt
 following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the
 Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and
 the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony
 ordained of God.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be
 carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as
 worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect or operation: but
 they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation, as
 Saint Paul saith.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>
 XXVI. Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect
 of the Sacrament
 </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and
 sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word
 and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name,
 but in Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may
 use their ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving of
 the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by
 their wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by
 faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be
 effectual, because of Christ's institution and promise, although they be
 ministered by evil then.
 </p>
 <p>
 Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that
 inquire be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that
 have knowledge of their offences; and finally being found guilty, by just
 judgement be deposed.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXVII. Of Baptism</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby
 Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened, but it is
 also a sign of Regeneration or new Birth, whereby, as by an instrument,
 they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the
 promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be sons of God by
 the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and
 Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The Baptism of young
 Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable
 with the institution of Christ.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXVIII. Of the Lord's Supper</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians
 ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather is a Sacrament
 of our Redemption by Christ's death: insomuch that to such as rightly,
 worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a
 partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a
 partaking of the Blood of Christ.
 </p>
 <p>
 Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in
 the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to
 the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and
 hath given occasion to many superstitions.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Body of Christ is given, taken and eaten in the Supper, only after an
 heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is
 received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved,
 carried about, lifted up or worshipped.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>
 XXIX. Of the Wicked which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of the
 Lord's Supper
 </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Wicked. and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do
 carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the
 Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they
 partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do cat and drink
 the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXX. Of both kinds</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the
 parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and commandment,
 ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXXI. Of the Oblation of Christ of Christ finished upon the Cross</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation,
 and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and
 actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone.
 Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said,
 that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have
 remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous
 deceits.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 Bishops, Priests and Deacons are not commanded by God's Law, either to vow
 the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is
 lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to mary at their own
 discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXXIII. Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 That person whcih by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off
 from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the
 whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be
 openly reconciled by penance and received into the Church by a Judge that
 hath authority thereunto.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one,
 and utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be
 changed according to the diversities of countries, times, and men's
 manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's Word. Whosoever through
 his private judgement, willingly and purposely, cloth openly break the
 traditions and ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the
 Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be
 rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that
 offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the
 authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak
 brethren.
 </p>
 <p>
 Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and
 abolish, ceremonies or rites of the Church ordained only by man's
 authority, so that all things be done to edifying.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXXV. Of the Homilies</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined
 under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and
 necessary for these tunes, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which were
 set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge them to
 be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they
 may be understanded of the people.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong><em>Of the Names of the Homilies</em></strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">1. Of the right Use of the Church</p>

 <p class="nomargin">7. Of Prayer</p>
 <p class="nomargin">8. Of the Place and Time of Prayer</p>

 <p>
 <strong>XXXVI. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Book of Consecration of :archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering of
 Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the tine of Edward the Sixth, and
 confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, Both contain all
 things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering: neither bath it any
 thing, that of itself is superstitious and ungodly. And therefore
 whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that Book,
 since the second year of the forenamed King Edward unto this time, or
 hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same Rites; we
 decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and
 ordered.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXXVII. Of the Civil Magistrates</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The King's Majesty bath the chief power in this Realm of England, and
 other his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this
 Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes cloth
 appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign
 jurisdiction.
 </p>
 <p>
 Where we attribute to the King's Majesty the chief government, by which
 Titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended; we
 give not to our Princes the ministering either of God's Word, or of the
 Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by
 Elizabeth our Queen do most plainly testify; but that only prerogative,
 which we see to have been given always to all godly Princes in Holy
 Scriptures by God himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and
 degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical
 or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evildoers.
 </p>
 <p>The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.</p>
 <p>
 The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and
 grievous offences.
 </p>
 <p>
 It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to
 wear weapons, and serve in the wars.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXXVIII. Of Christian men's Goods, which are not common</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 The Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right,
 title, and possession of the same, as certain Anabaptists do falsely
 boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth,
 liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>XXXIX. Of a Christian man's oath</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="first">
 As we confess that vain and rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by
 our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle, so we judge, that Christian
 Religion cloth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate
 requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the
 Prophet's teaching, injustice, judgement, and truth.
