Here are the relevant passages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eNow after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave. And behold, \u003cstrong\u003ea severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it\u003c/strong\u003e. And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men. The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified.\" (Matthew 28:1-5 NASB)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eAnd they were saying to one another, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?\" And looking up, \u003cstrong\u003ethey saw that the stone had been rolled back\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026mdash;it was very large. (Mark 16:3-4)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd they found the stone rolled away from the tomb\u003c/strong\u003e... (Luke 24:2)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eNow on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and \u003cstrong\u003esaw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb\u003c/strong\u003e. (John 20:1)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThe apparent contradiction here is that while Mark, Luke, and John write that the stone was \u003cstrong\u003ealready\u003c/strong\u003e rolled away when the women arrived at the tomb, Matthew appears to be saying that the stone was rolled away \u003cstrong\u003eafter\u003c/strong\u003e the women arrived. Also, Matthew includes details about an earthquake, while the other gospels do not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eA reasonable explanation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eIt would be reasonable to believe that the earthquake, the angel coming, the stone being rolled away, the angel sitting on the stone, and the guards fainting and/or fleeing all happened before the women arrived at the tomb. The NASB translation, quoted above, uses the verb \"had occurred,\" rather than \"there was,\" which suggests that the events in verses 2-4 occurred before the women arrived at the tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eIt would make sense for Matthew to be using verses 2-4 to provide extra context regarding the scene that the women encountered when they arrived at the tomb. Verses 2-4 would help explain the lack of guards at the tomb when the women arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThus, in all four accounts, the stone would have been rolled away \u003cstrong\u003ebefore\u003c/strong\u003e the women arrived at the tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003ch3\u003eGeneral notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003eThe differences between the gospels point to their authenticity\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eWhat would actually be \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e suspicious is if all four gospel accounts were identical. This would mean that they collaborated, perhaps even conspired, with one another to produce a perfectly harmonized resurrection account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eHowever, what we see instead is four accounts that have significant differences between them, which points towards the fact that each author simply reported the events that he heard about himself. So, rather than producing doubt, the differences between the gospel accounts should actually make us more confident in the historicity of the resurrection accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003ch4\u003eIt is perfectly normal for eyewitness accounts to differ\u003c/h4\u003e\n \n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eNot every witness to an event recalls all of the details perfectly, or in the exact same way, so we should expect various accounts of the resurrection events to differ from one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003ch4\u003eThe key is that there are no irreconcilable contradictions\u003c/h4\u003e\n \n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eAs long as we can provide \u003cstrong\u003epossibilities\u003c/strong\u003e for how the various resurrection accounts could reconcile into one coherent narrative, then there would be no irreconcilable, or necessary contradiction. This would then allow us to continue believing in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible without any compromise.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003ch4\u003e\"But, I'm not convinced by your explanations. I still think these are irreconcilable contradictions.\"\u003c/h4\u003e\n \n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eIt's likely that non-believers won't accept the possible explanations that we provide concerning reconciling the apparent contradictions in the resurrection narratives. However, their refusal to accept these explanations is not based upon the fact that reasonable and possible explanations have been provided, but simply upon the fact that they don't \u003cstrong\u003ewant\u003c/strong\u003e to believe that there are legitimately reasonable and possible explanations.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eTheir goal is simply to continue justifying their unbelief in the Bible, regardless of any fact or explanation provided to them. So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do. We should inform them that they are being unreasonable and stubborn, and that they are simply trying to shut their minds to the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","date_added":"2018-10-10","updated_at":"2018-11-13T22:01:29.880Z","tags":[{"id":1,"slug":"apologetics","url":"/tags/apologetics","title":"Apologetics","description":"Answers to apologetics questions.

Therefore, the God of the Bible does not exist.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ol\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eThe solution to the \"problem\"\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eThe solution to the \"problem of evil\" is that #1 above does not necessary result in #2. It is true that the Bible teaches that God is love (1 John 4:8) and that God is all-powerful (Jeremiah 32:27).\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eHowever, that God is love and that He is all-powerful does not necessarily mean that evil and suffering would not exist in the world. There is another possible conclusion, namely, that \u003cB\u003eGod has a good purpose for the existence of evil and sufference\u003c/B\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cimg src=\"/images/purpose.png\" class=\"image-left\" /\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eWhat could this good purpose be? Well, the Bible teaches that evil and suffering result in both God's glory (in Jesus being the ultimate conquerer of evil and suffering) and greater joy for God's people (who experience firsthand God saving them from their own evil and granting them the joy of being a redeemed people who will spend eternity in heaven).\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eColossians 2:13-15, illustrates that sin (which includes evil and suffering) can have a good purpose because in this passage, we see God \"triumphing\" over sin (which exhibits God's glory), which produces joy in God's people (who have been \"made alive\" and \"forgiven\"). Without the existence of sin, evil, and suffering, these two things could not happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003eColossians 2:13-15\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eAnd you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God \u003cB\u003emade alive\u003c/B\u003e together with him, having \u003cB\u003eforgiven\u003c/B\u003e us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by \u003cB\u003etriumphing\u003c/B\u003e over them in him.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003e\"But those good things aren't worth the amount of evil and suffering that exist in the world!\"\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eThe answer given above to the \"problem of evil\" does not neglect the fact that there is a tremendous amount of evil and suffering in the world, and that we should feel deep empathy for those who are suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eHowever, the answer does demonstrate that the Bible is not self-contradictory regarding the \"problem of evil.\" The idea that God's good purposes are not worth the amount of evil and suffering that exist in the world is a subjective opinion without any real justification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eTo the objector: Where do you get your definition of evil?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eIf one of your objections to the Bible is the \"problem of evil,\" where do you get your definition of evil in the first place?

And yet they are not three Lords but one Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 19. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge\n every Person by himself to be God and Lord;\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 20. So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say; There are three\n Gods or three Lords.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e21. The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 22. The Son is of the Father alone; not made nor created, but begotten.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 23. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor\n created, nor begotten, but proceeding.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 24. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons;\n one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 25. And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or\n less than another.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e26. But the whole three persons are coeternal, and coequal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 27. So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the\n Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 28. He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 29. Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also\n believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 30. For the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus\n Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 31. God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and\n man of substance of His mother, born in the world.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 32. Perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh\n subsisting.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 33. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the\n Father as touching His manhood.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 34. Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 35. One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of\n that manhood into God.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 36. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 37. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one\n Christ;\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 38. Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the\n third day from the dead;\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 39. He ascended into heaven, He sits on the right hand of the Father, God,\n Almighty;\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e40. From thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e41. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e42. and shall give account of their own works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 43. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting and they\n that have done evil into everlasting fire.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n 44. This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he\n cannot be saved.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n","date_added":"2018-09-28","updated_at":"2018-11-13T22:02:02.049Z","tags":[{"id":4,"slug":"creeds-confessions","url":"/tags/creeds-confessions","title":"Creeds and confessions","description":"Read the historic creeds and confessions.

In this article, Zindler's thesis is that \"It is easier to account for the facts of early Christian history if Jesus were a fiction than if he once were real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThe purpose of this post is to demonstrate that Zindler's thesis is wrong. Here, we will not quote Zindler's entire article, but only the relevant parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eZindler compares Jesus to Zeus, Thor, Isir, and Osiris\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eEven in the case of other deities, such as Zeus, Thor, Isis, and Osiris, I had always taken it for granted that they were merely deified human heroes: men and women who lived in the later stages of prehistory – persons whose reputations got better and better the longer the time elapsed after their deaths. Gods, like fine wines, I supposed, improved with age.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eComparing Jesus to \"other deities\" such as Zeus, Thor, Isis, and Osiris is absurd. The very obvious and enormous difference between Jesus and these other deities is that whereas Jesus has always been claimed to have been a very specific person who existed during a very specific time and place in actual history, having eyewitness accounts of specific things he did during his physical life on earth, these other deities have absolutely no such characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eIf Zindler believes these other deities have these same characteristics that were just listed about Jesus, the burden of proof is upon him to demonstrate this. As it stands, there is simply no meaningful comparison between Jesus and other deities such as the ones Zindler listed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eZindler's thesis\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eI now feel it is more reasonable to suppose he never existed. It is easier to account for the facts of early Christian history if Jesus were a fiction than if he once were real.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThree points to note here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003col\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eFirst, \"more reasonable\" is a very subjective position. After reading this post's responses to Zindler's arguments, one will just as easily be able to say that it is \"more reasonable\" to believe that Jesus existed. In fact, the fact that the large majority of people believe that Jesus existed points to his existence being \"more reasonable\" to believe than his non-existence.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eThe definitive argument for Jesus' existence does not rest in anything external to the Bible, but rather in presuppositional argumentation, which states that one must presuppose the Bible (or, that God has revealed Truth through the Bible) in order for Truth, logic, and knowledge to even be possible in the first place. Thus, one who denies the Bible denies the only legitimate explanation for knowledge itself. Presuppositional apologetics will be covered in another post.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eIt's worthwhile to recognize that Zindler is biased. He wants to believe that Jesus did not exist, and so his interpretation of the facts will be biased in that direction.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ol\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eThe burden of proof\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eAlthough what follows may fairly be interpreted to be a proof of the non-historicity of Jesus, it must be realized that the burden of proof does not rest upon the skeptic in this matter. As always is the case, the burden of proof weighs upon those who assert that some thing or some process exists. If someone claims that he never has to shave because every morning before he can get to the bathroom he is assaulted by a six-foot rabbit with extremely sharp teeth who trims his whiskers better than a razor – if someone makes such a claim, no skeptic need worry about constructing a disproof. Unless evidence for the claim is produced, the skeptic can treat the claim as false. This is nothing more than sane, every-day practice.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eJust like before, when Zindler compares Jesus to other deities like Zeus and Thor, again Zindler makes an absurd comparison by comparing Jesus to \"a six-foot rabbit...\". Claiming that \"a six-foot rabbit\" exists is \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely\u003c/strong\u003e different from claiming that Jesus existed. It seems that Zindler is trying to manipulate the reader emotionally into thinking that believing in Jesus' existence is akin to believing in something like \"a six-foot rabbit,\" which is extremely deceptive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eWhat are the obvious differences? Well, there are actual writings in history that describe in great detail actual things that Jesus did during his life, things for which there were eyewitness accounts, and there was an enormous movement that started, and continues strongly to this day, as a result of these things that Jesus did. There is physical, tangible, observable evidence that point strongly in the direction of Jesus' existence. In contrast, the concept of this \"six-foot rabbit\" that Zindler brings up is utterly ridiculous at the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eAs for the burden of proof, Zindler's logic is not convincing. It seems to be far more reasonable for the burden of proof to be upon those who do not believe Jesus existed, since the vast majority of people throughout history have believed in Jesus' existence, and there are numerous physical documents that are used as evidence for Jesus' existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eOf course, Zindler does attempt to show that these documents do not prove Jesus' existence, but to purport that the burden of proof rests in the nearly-unanimous majority is simply untrue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eComparing Jesus to Tiberius Caesar is irrelevant\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eI generally agree that N.T. Wright's usage of Tiberius Caesar is not very helpful. Proving that Jesus existed versus proving that Tiberius Caesar existed are quite different tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eWe will skip responding to this section, since it is not directly relevant to proving Jesus' existence. The evidences for Jesus' existence are simply different than the evidences for Tiberius Caesar's existence, since they were very different men with very different roles in history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eThe Old Testament \"evidence\"\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eI generally agree with Zindler that the Old Testament is not directly relevant to the discussion of Jesus' existence in terms of empirical evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eHowever, I disagree with his statement that \"All of the many examples of OT 'predictions' of Jesus are so silly that one need only look them up to see their irrelevance.\" Since Zindler does not go any further into demonstrating the irrelevance of Old Testament prophecies, all I will say here is that, contrary to Zindler's claim, there is strong evidence that Jesus fulfills exactly the descriptions of many Old Testament prophecies, which points towards both Jesus' existence and the reliability of the Bible. But, the better place for arguing for this position would be another post, since this is a different type of argument for Jesus' existence than the ones we are examining here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eThe New Testament evidence - Revelation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eA third category of writing, apocalyptic, of which the Book of Revelation is an example, also exists, but it gives no support for the historicity of Jesus. In fact, it would appear to be an intellectual fossil of the thought-world from which Christianity sprang – a Jewish apocalypse that was reworked for Christian use. The main character of the book (referred to 28 times) would seem to be “the Lamb,” an astral being seen in visions (no claims to historicity here!), and the book overall is redolent of ancient astrology.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThe book of revelation provides support for the historicity of Jesus in two ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003col\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eIts author is John, one of Jesus' apostles, an eyewitness of Jesus' life. In a citation below, Zindler says that it is \"extremely doubtful\" that John was even a historical figure, but the burden of proof for this claim is certainly upon the skeptic, since the book itself says that the author is John and there was no dispute about Revelation's authorship until relatively recently.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eIt references someone named Jesus, whom John knew and had a relationship with. It is illogical to believe that John is writing about an imaginary character he invented. Although the Jesus John refers to in Revelation is the post-resurrected, post-ascended Jesus, it can be assumed that this Jesus is the same Jesus that John knew while Jesus lived on the earth.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ol\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eZindler's statement that the book of Revelation \"is redolent of ancient astrology\" is misleading and irrelevant. There are enough differences between the book of Revelation and \"ancient astrology\" that one cannot equate the two so simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eThe name Jesus occurs only seven times in the entire book, Christ only four times, and Jesus Christ only twice!\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis is absolutely silly. The number of times \"Jesus,\" \"Christ,\" and \"Jesus Christ\" occur in Revelation is not an argument at all against John's portrayal of Jesus as a real person/being. There are many places in Revelation where John is clearly referring to Jesus without actually using his name, such as when John refers to \"the lamb,\" so Jesus shows up in far more of the book of Revelation than Zindler would lead us to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eIt seems that Zindler's implication here is that the lack of times Jesus is specificlaly mentioned points to the fact that the author of Revelation simply took an existing story and added in a few references to Jesus. However, as mentioned above, Revelation contains far more references to Jesus, enough that the book of Revelation can be considered significantly different from other kinds of \"ancient astrology.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eWhile Revelation may very well derive from a very early period (contrary to the views of most biblical scholars, who deal with the book only in its final form), the Jesus of which it whispers obviously is not a man. He is a supernatural being. He has not yet acquired the physiological and metabolic properties of which we read in the gospels. The Jesus of Revelation is a god who would later be made into a man – not a man who would later become a god, as liberal religious scholars would have it.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eHere are the numerous problems with this paragraph:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003col\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eOftentimes, when someone writes that \"most biblical scholars\" hold to a particular position, that person means \"most biblical scholars that I consider legitimate, and I do not consider biblical scholars who hold a conservative view of the Bible to be legitimate.\" The term \"most biblical scholars\" is quite subjective and not at all an accurate or useful term when used in this way.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eAlthough the Jesus in Revelation is the post-resurrected, post-ascended Jesus, John still describes Jesus as having a human form, and we can assume that this is the same Jesus that John wrote about earlier as having lived and walked on the earth as a human man.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eThe next few sentences are simply completely inaccurate. It is simply inaccurate that the Jesus in Revelation \"has not yet acquired the physiological and metabolic properties of which we read in the gospels.\" Rather, the events in Revelation occur \u003cstrong\u003eafter\u003c/strong\u003e the gospels, so in Revelation, Jesus has \u003cstrong\u003ealready\u003c/strong\u003e lived his life on earth. The Jesus in Revelation is not at all \"a god who would later be made into a man.\" Zindler is simply completely wrong in his understanding of Jesus in Revelation in this section of his article.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ol\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eThe Gospels\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eThe notion that the four “gospels that made the cut” to be included in the official New Testament were written by men named Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John does not go back to early Christian times. The titles “According to Matthew,” etc., were not added until late in the second century.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eAlthough the authors of the four gospels are not named in the gospels themselves, there was no dispute in the early church concerning their authorship. It was simply assumed that the four gospels were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The lack of debate in the early church concerning the authorship of the gospels points to the fact that they were indeed written by these authors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003ePapias and Justin Martyr\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eThus, although Papias ca. 140 CE (‘Common Era’) knows all the gospels but has only heard of Matthew and Mark, Justin Martyr (ca. 150 CE) knows of none of the four supposed authors.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eHere, Zindler's language is, at best, over-simplified and confusing, and, at worst, deceptive. Here are several points in response:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003col\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eFirst, what exactly is \"knows all the gospels but has only heard of Matthew and Mark\" supposed to mean? I simply have no idea what \"knows all the gospels\" is supposed to mean, and the assertion, \"but has only heard of Matthew and Mark\" is extremely misleading. More accurately, Papias only mentions Matthew and Mark in the passage we have concerning what he says about gospel authorship. To conclude that Papias \"has only heard\" of the gospels mentioned in this passage requires an enormous leap of logic. He could simply not have written anything about the other gospels. We simply do not know.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eSecond, ignoring everything else, it remains that Papias wrote about Matthew and Mark, and that Papias lived at a time that was very close to the time that the original authors would have lived. There are strong arguments that Papias's writing demonstrates that Mark was indeed the author of Mark and that Matthew's writing was likely the foundation upon which the Greek version of Matthew was based. Zindler unjustifiably dismisses the weight of Papias's writing by making another misleading statement concerning Justin Martyr, which we will examine in the third point below. For more information, see \u003ca href=\"/bible/papias-authorship\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePapias and gospel authorship\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003ePapias writes that Justin Martyr \"knows of none of the four supposed authors,\" which is another very misleading statement. Just because Martyr does not mention any of the authors by name does not at all mean that he \"knows of none of the four supposed authors.\" Zindler is making a completely unjustified assertion here, and not only that, Martyr's writings contain information that is relevant to Mark's authorship, which we will examine in the fourth point below.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eIn his writings, Martyr mentions the \"memoirs of [Peter],\" and says that in these memoirs, it is written that Jesus changed the name of one of the apostles to Peter and also changed the name of the sons of Zebedee to Boanerges, meaning sons of thunder. These two events are not in the so-called Gospel of Peter, but they are both in the Gospel of Mark, and the second event is found \u003cstrong\u003eonly\u003c/strong\u003e in Mark. Furthermore, Papias wrote that Mark was Peter's interpreter, which would lead us to believe that Mark was the author of Peter's memoirs. For more information, see \u003ca href=\"/bible/martyr-authorship\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJustin Martyr and the Authorship of Mark?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ol\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eIrenaeus\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eIt is only in 180 CE, with Irenaeus of Lyons, that we learn who wrote the four \"canonical\" gospels and discover that there are exactly four of them because there are four quarters of the earth and four universal winds. Thus, unless one supposes the argument of Irenaeus to be other than ridiculous, we come to the conclusion that the gospels are of unknown origin and authorship, and there is no good reason to suppose they are eye-witness accounts of a man named Jesus of Nazareth.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThere is a huge problem with Zindler's logic here. To dismiss Irenaeus's statements concerning the authorship of the gospels simply because he finds \u003cstrong\u003esomething else\u003c/strong\u003e Irenaeus wrote to be \"ridiculous\" is not logical at all. What Irenaeus says concerning the authorship of the gospels does not become negated because of something else Irenaeus says that is really not relevant to the dicussion of authorship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eBecause of all this, The conclusion that Zindler reaches is not at all valid. The writings of Papias, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus, as well as the lack of debate during this time concerning the authorship of the gospels, all point towards the traditional view that the gospels were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eAt a minimum, this forces us to examine the gospels to see if their contents are even compatible with the notion that they were written by eye-witnesses. We cannot even assume that each of the gospels had but one author or redactor.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eOf course, we should examine these questions, but so far, we do not have good reason to believe anything other than that the gospels were each written by one author, and that these authors were eyewitnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eMatthew and Luke's usage of Mark\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eIt is clear that the gospels of Matthew and Luke could not possibly have been written by an eye-witness of the tales they tell. Both writers plagiarize (largely word-for-word) up to 90% of the gospel of Mark, to which they add sayings of Jesus and would-be historical details.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eAgain, this is absolutely terrible reasoning from Zindler, as well as deceptive wording. A more position way of phrasing what Zindler writes is, \"Both writers use Mark as a source, and they include additional details in specific ways to emphasize the particular message they are trying to communicate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThat Matthew and Luke utilized (\"plagiarized\" is an unnecessarily loaded term) Mark does \u003cstrong\u003enot at all\u003c/strong\u003e lead to the conclusion that \"Matthew and Luke could not possibly have been written by an eye-witness of the tales they tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eMatthew and Luke's genealogies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eIgnoring the fact that Matthew and Luke contradict each other in such critical details as the genealogy of Jesus – and thus cannot both be correct –\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThere are several legitimate explanations for the seeming discrepency between Matthew and Luke's genealogies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eWork in progress...\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n","date_added":"2018-09-21","updated_at":"2018-11-14T04:18:42.066Z","tags":[{"id":1,"slug":"apologetics","url":"/tags/apologetics","title":"Apologetics","description":"Answers to apologetics questions.

From these references, we learn that Papias wrote a work called \u003cem\u003eExposition of the Sayings of the Lord\u003c/em\u003e, which is an important early source for the authorship of the gospels. Eusebius writes that Papias was Bishop of Hierapolis around the time of Ignatius of Antioch.[1]\n\n \u003ch3\u003eWhen did Papias live?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003ePapias's writing is dated by most modern scholars to be about 95\u0026ndash;120.[2][3] Irenaeus, who was Polycarp's disciple, describes Papias as \"an ancient man who was a hearer of John and a companion of Polycarp.\"[4] Polycarp is said to have been a disciple of John by Irenaeus and Tertullian.[5][6]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eWhat all of this means is that Papias supposedly had direct contact with a man who had direct contact with John, which places Papias extremely close to the original writing of the gospels. This gives what he says about the authorship of the gospels great weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eWhat does Papias write concerning gospel authorship?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eThis passage is from Eusebius's writings. Emphasis is added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003e[Papias, who is now mentioned by us, \u003cstrong\u003eaffirms that he received the sayings of the apostles from those who accompanied them, and he moreover asserts that he heard in person Aristion and the presbyter John\u003c/strong\u003e. Accordingly he mentions them frequently by name, and in his writings gives their traditions. Our notice of these circumstances may not be without its use. It may also be worth while to add to the statements of Papias already given, other passages of his in which he relates some miraculous deeds, stating that he acquired the knowledge of them from tradition. The residence of the Apostle Philip with his daughters in Hierapolis has been mentioned above. We must now point out how Papias, who lived at the same time, relates that he had received a wonderful narrative from the daughters of Philip. For he relates that a dead man was raised to life in his day. He also mentions another miracle relating to Justus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a deadly poison, and received no harm, on account of the grace of the Lord. The same person, moreover, has set down other things as coming to him from unwritten tradition, amongst these some strange parables and instructions of the Saviour, and some other things of a more fabulous nature. Amongst these he says that there will be a millennium after the resurrection from the dead, when the personal reign of Christ will be established on this earth. He moreover hands down, in his own writing, other narratives given by the previously mentioned Aristion of the Lord's sayings, and the traditions of the presbyter John. For information on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books themselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add, as being a matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding Mark who wrote the Gospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words]: And the presbyter said this. \u003cstrong\u003eMark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements.\u003c/strong\u003e [This is what is related by Papias regarding Mark; but with regard to Matthew he has made the following statements]: \u003cstrong\u003eMatthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.\u003c/strong\u003e [The same person uses proofs from the First Epistle of John, and from the Epistle of Peter in like manner. And he also gives another story of a woman who was accused of many sins before the Lord, which is to be found in the Gospel according to the Hebrews.][7]\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eMark wrote what he heard from Peter\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eMark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him.

This is very strong evidence that Mark is indeed the author of the book of Mark that is one of the four gospels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003eMatthew wrote in the Hebrew language\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote class=\"first\"\u003eMatthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eHere, Papias writes that Matthew wrote \"in the Hebrew language.\" However the book of Matthew that we have is written in Greek.

In other words, rather than directly causing anyone to have faith, predestination simpy involves God looking down the corridor of time to see which humans would choose Jesus themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eThe primary two passages used to support this view of predestination are Romans 8:29 and 1 Peter 1:1-2.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cblockquote\u003eFor those whom he \u003cstrong\u003eforeknew\u003c/strong\u003e he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n \n \u003cblockquote\u003e...To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the \u003cstrong\u003eforeknowledge\u003c/strong\u003e of God the Father...\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eThe argument is that this passage teaches that God's predestination is based upon his \"foreknowledge,\" which is merely passive knowledge of what humans would freely decide for themselves\u0026mdash;predestination is not God actively deciding exactly whom He would save.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003ch3\u003eThe response\u003c/h3\u003e\n \n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eThe key to responding to this argument against the Calvinistic view of predestination is recognizing that this argument's definition of God's \"foreknowledge\" does not come from the Bible, but rather imposes an outside definition of \"foreknowledge\" upon the Bible. In the Bible, God's \"foreknowledge\" is not passive, but is actually active. Here is what Jeremiah 1:5 says concerning God's \"foreknowledge\" of Jeremiah:\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cblockquote\u003eBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eIn this passage, we learn that God \"knew\" Jeremiah \"before\" he was born, or He \"foreknew\" Jeremiah. However, here, God's \"foreknowledge\" of Jeremiah is not a foreknowledge of what kind of a person Jeremiah would be, but rather an active determining of the life that Jeremiah would live. Jeremiah did not choose himself to become a \"prophet to the nations,\" but rather, God \"foreknew\" Jeremiah and determined that he would become a \"prophet to the nations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003ch4\u003eThe difference between predestination and God's foreknowledge\u003c/h4\u003e\n \n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eSome object to this view of God's foreknowledge because they claim that this makes predestination and God's foreknowledge the same thing, whereas there is a clear distinction between the two in Romans 8.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eHowever, this is a false claim because there is indeed a significant difference between predestination and God's foreknowledge. God's foreknowledge of a person involves God actively fore-loving a person (not passively waiting to see how that person would respond to Jesus in the future), and predestination refers to the specific plan that God has set in motion to save that person. They are both part of the Golden Chain in Romans 8. One leads to the other; God's foreknowledge leads to predestination.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eHere are several passages that help us understand that God's \"foreknowledge\" of a person is an active fore-loving of that person, rather than a passive knowledge of what that person would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eIn the very same chapter as 1 Peter 1:1-2, we find a clarification concerning what God's \"foreknowledge\" is:\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cblockquote\u003eHe was \u003cstrong\u003eforeknown\u003c/strong\u003e before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you...\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eIn this passage, we learn that Jesus was \"foreknown\" by God. However, this \"foreknowledge\" of Christ is clearly not just a passive knowledge about Christ, but is rather an active, intimate love of Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eExodus 33:17 says this:\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003cblockquote\u003eAnd the Lord said to Moses, \"This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I \u003cstrong\u003eknow\u003c/strong\u003e you by name.\"\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n \n \u003cp\u003eAgain, we see here that God's knowledge of Moses is not a mere passive knowledge, but rather involves love and intimacy.

Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached by him.

Here are the relevant passages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eAnd behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone \u003cstrong\u003eand sat on it\u003c/strong\u003e. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.\" (Matthew 28:2-5)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eAnd entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. And he said to them, \"Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.\" (Mark 16:5-6)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eAnd they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when \u003cstrong\u003ethey went in\u003c/strong\u003e they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold, \u003cstrong\u003etwo men stood by them\u003c/strong\u003e in dazzling apparel. And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? (Luke 24:2-6)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eAnd she saw two angels in white, \u003cstrong\u003esitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet\u003c/strong\u003e. They said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping?\" She said to them, \"They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.\" (John 20:12-13)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eWas there an angel sitting on a stone, a young man sitting on the right side inside the tomb, two men standing by the women, or one angel at the head and another at the feet of where Jesus had lain? The apparent contradiction is that whereas Matthew writes that an angel sat on the stone, the other three gospels say that the angels were inside the tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eA reasonable explanation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eIn Matthew, what we know is that the angel was sitting on the stone when the guards saw him, and \"for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.\" It is reasonable to believe that after this happened, the angel in Matthew did not remain on the stone, but rather met the women when they went inside the tomb, as the other gospels report.

There are several good reasons to believe that there is no contradiction between the two authors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003eMatthew and Luke clearly have different objectives with their genealogies\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eThe most significant factor to consider is that it is clear that Matthew and Luke are not trying to accomplish the same things with their genealogies.

There was no Greek word for \"son-in-law,\" so perhaps Joseph was the \"son of Heli\" in the sense that he was married to Mary, Heli's daughter. Then, Joseph would have descended from David's son Solomon, while Mary would have descended from David's son Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eAlthough it would have been unusual to trace a genealogy through a mother's side (Mary's side), Mary was an extraordinary woman. Furthermore, Luke's genealogy does not occur until later in the book, after Luke has introduced Mary and told part of the story from her point of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003eEusebius's explanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eAnother possible explanation, which was held by the church historian Eusebius, is that Matthew's genealogy is a biological genealogy, while Luke's genealogy is legal genealogy. In Jewish tradition, if a man died without having any sons, his brother would marry the widow and have a son who could carry on the family name. Eusebius noted that Melchi (\u003cspan class=\"scripture\"\u003eLuke 3:24\u003c/span\u003e) and Matthan (\u003cspan class=\"scripture\"\u003eMatthew 1:15\u003c/span\u003e) were both married to the same woman at different times, which would make Heli (\u003cspan class=\"scripture\"\u003eLuke 3:23\u003c/span\u003e) and Jacob (\u003cspan class=\"scripture\"\u003eMatthew 1:15\u003c/span\u003e) half-brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThen, perhaps, when Heli died without a son, his half-brother Jacob married Heli's widow. This would mean that Joseph is \u003cem\u003elegally\u003c/em\u003e the son of Heli, but \u003cem\u003ebiologically\u003c/em\u003e the son of Jacob. Then, Jacob would be the descendent of Solomon, and Heli would be the descendent of Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003eWe should give Matthew and Luke the benefit of the doubt\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eBecause of all of the factors listed above, we should assume that Matthew and Luke would not write genealogies that are so directly contradictory. It is likely that they would have been able to double-check their facts, especially because genealogies were extremely important to the Jews.

In fact, the Gospel of Mark is the \u003cstrong\u003eonly\u003c/strong\u003e gospel that includes the event of Jesus changing the names of the sons of Zebedee. In Mark 3:16-17, we read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cblockquote\u003eHe appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eFrom this, we can conclude that Justin's reference to the \"memoirs of [Peter]\" is a reference to the book of the gospels that we call Mark. This matches exactly with what we know about the relationship between Peter and Mark, namely, that Mark interpreted and wrote on behalf of Peter (see \u003ca href=\"/answers/bible/papias-authorship\"\u003ePapias and gospel authorship\u003c/a\u003e for what Papias writes about this).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eThus, Justin's writing provides support for the traditional authorship of the gospel of Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n \u003c/div\u003e\n","date_added":"2018-09-26","updated_at":"2018-11-14T04:47:25.788Z","tags":[{"id":1,"slug":"apologetics","url":"/tags/apologetics","title":"Apologetics","description":"Answers to apologetics questions.

So, we can do our best to provide these reasonable and possible explanations to them, but if they blindly close their minds to them, then we have simply done all that we can do.

Here is what the verse says:\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cblockquote\u003eI will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children...\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \n  \u003ch3\u003eThe answer\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \n  \u003ch4\u003eOne consequence of sin is pain\u003c/h4\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eIn the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve sinned against God by eating the forbidden fruit, and one consequence of sin is pain.

Romans 5:12 says this:\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cblockquote\u003eTherefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned...\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThis is known as the doctrine of original sin. So, because Adam sinned, all humans, including all women, are now also guilty of sin, and one of the consequences of this sin is pain in childbearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003ch4\u003eOriginal sin is not unfair\u003c/h4\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eOur instinctive reaction against the doctrine of original sin is that it is unfair. However, this is because we are evaluating God's decrees by human standards, which are flawed, and not by God's standards, which are right.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eOriginal sin is not unfair simply because it is part of God's will and decree. God created Adam to be the \"head,\" or representative, of all mankind, and we have no grounds upon which to object against this decision of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003ePaul responds to those who would object against God's decree by writing this:\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cblockquote\u003eBut who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, \"Why have you made me like this?\"\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eIn other words, God has the right to make Adam our representative head simply because He is the creator and we are not.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003ch3\u003eConclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eGod causing all women to have pain in childbearing because of the sin of Adam and Eve is not immoral because sin has consequences and because Adam was the representative head of all mankind. This means that every human after Adam would inherit a sin nature, and part of this sin nature involves women experiencing pain in childbirth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div","date_added":"2018-11-10","updated_at":"2018-11-13T22:02:28.205Z","tags":[{"id":1,"slug":"apologetics","url":"/tags/apologetics","title":"Apologetics","description":"Answers to apologetics questions.

The ordinance of Christian baptism had not started yet\u003c/h4\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eThose who believe that baptism is necessary for salvation are often asked the question, \"Did the thief on the cross need to be baptized to be saved?

The answer is that the phrase, \"born of water,\" in this context must not be referring to baptism at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThere are two reasonable options for interpreting the phrase, \"born of water,\" that do not involve it referring to baptism.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003ch4\u003e3. \"born of water\" possibly refers to natural birth\u003c/h4\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eSome suggest that the phrase, \"born of water,\" could refer to natural birth, saying that \"water\" refers to the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb and that flows from the womb right before childbirth.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eIn this interpretation, Jesus is saying that one must be born physically, as well as spiritually, to be \"born again,\" or to \"enter the kingdom of God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eHowever, there are two reasons to believe that this is not the best interpretation of the phrase, \"born of water\":\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eFirst, we have no example of people during this time using the phrase, \"born of water,\" in this manner.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eSecond, the phrase, \"born of water and the Spirit\" parallel the phrase used earlier, \"born again,\" so it is more likely that being \"born of water\" and \"born of the Spirit\" both directly relate to being \"born again.\" Physical birth is not directly related to being \"born again.\"\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003c/ol\u003e\n  \n  \u003ch4\u003e3. \"born of water\" likely refers to the Old Testament concept of spiritual washing or cleansing\u003c/h4\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eMost likely, the phrase, \"born of water,\" refers to the Old Testament concept of water providing spiritual washing and cleansing, and the phrase, \"born of the Spirit,\" refers to the Old Testament concept of the Spirit providing renewal and power.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eWhen Jesus uses the phrase, \"born of water and the Spirit,\" he assumes that Nicodemus would be familiar with his language because he says later to Nicodemus, in John 3:10, \"Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?\" So, it is very likely that in John 3:5, Jesus is referring to Old Testament concepts (and certainly not to Christian baptism, which was not in effect yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eHere are several relevant Old Testament passages about water and the Spirit that Nicodemus would have been familiar with.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEzekiel 36:24-27\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp class=\"first\"\u003eEzekiel 36:24-27 is likely the specific passage Jesus had in mind when he used spoke the words in John 3:5 because it is a perfect illustration of what Jesus is talking about.

In Genesis 6:3, God sees the increasing sin in humans and says this:\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cblockquote\u003eMy Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years. (Genesis 6:3)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThen, immediately after this, Genesis 6:5-7 describes God responding to the sin of mankind with the flood:\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cblockquote\u003eThe Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
