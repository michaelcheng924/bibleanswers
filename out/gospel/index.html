 <h3>Introduction</h3>

 <p class="first">Does your life have purpose and meaning? Or are you simply a product of random chemical processes, a miniscule and insignificant speck in a naturalistic, uncaring universe?</p>

 <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/GBHYcOR.png" class="image image-left" height="200" width="300"></amp-img>

 <p>The truth is that your life does indeed have purpose and meaning. God created the universe and humans, and He has revealed exactly why He created us.</p>
 
 <p>At the heart of why God created humans is the gospel, or the good news, of Jesus Christ. The gospel is the most important truth in the universe for every human to learn.</p>
 
 <p>Here, we will summarize the gospel, and then provide you with resources for how to continue your lifelong journey of learning more and more about the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
 
 <p>To begin, let's first learn about the Bible, which is where we learn about the gospel.</p>

 <a id="bible"></a>

 <h3>Bible</h3>

 <p class="first">The Bible is how God has chosen to reveal Himself and His plans to humans. Throughout history, God chose to use ordinary humans to record His revelation in writings that would become the Bible that we have today. And today, these writings, preserved in the Bible, are the sole source of our knowledge of God and truth.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be <strong>complete, equipped for every good work</strong> ." (2 Timothy 3:16-17)</blockquote>
 
 <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUTxzHM.png" class="image image-right" height="171" width="300"></amp-img>

 <p>The Bible is all we need to be "complete, equipped for every good work." We do not need anything else besides the Bible. Neither the additional teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, nor any direct revelation or voice from God, is necessary to be saved or to please God with the life we live.</p>
 
 <p>A common term used to describe the teaching that the Bible <strong>alone</strong> is sufficient for salvation and godliness is <strong>Sola Scriptura</strong>.</p>
 
 <p>Next, we will learn what the Bible teaches us about God.</p>

 <a id="god"></a>
 
 <h3>God</h3>
 
 <p class="first">What has God revealed about Himself through the Bible? First, God is the <strong>creator</strong>. He created the universe, humans, and everything else in the universe.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)</blockquote>
 
 <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/SahAJm1.png" class="image image-left" height="300" width="300"></amp-img>

 <p>That God is creator means that He has <strong>authority</strong> over everything in the universe. He created the universe for a specific purpose, namely, <strong>for His glory</strong>.</p>
 
 <p>Second, God is <strong>holy</strong>, which means that He is <strong>set apart in His perfect righteousness</strong>.</p>
 <blockquote>"There is none holy like the Lord: for there is none besides you." (1 Samuel 2:2a)</blockquote>
 
 <p>That God is holy and perfectly righteous means that He <strong>hates evil and sin and will certainly punish it</strong>. This is bad news for us because every human being has sinned against God by not perfectly obeying His commands.</p>
 
 <p>Next, we will learn about sin, which is the problem of every human.</p>

 <a id="sin"></a>
 
 <h3>Sin</h3>
 
 <p class="first">Every human being is guilty of sin before God in two ways:</p>
 
 <p>First, when Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, he sinned as the <strong>representative head</strong> of the human race, and because of his sin, every human being after him is therefore also guilty of his sin, which is often called <strong>original sin</strong>.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned." (Romans 5:12)</blockquote>
 
 <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/F4M8GSw.png" class="image image-right" height="195" width="300"></amp-img>

 <p>Although every human is guilty of sin simply "through one man" (Adam), every human is also guilty of <strong>personal sin</strong>.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one." (Romans 3:10-12)</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>"But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death." (Revelation 21:8)</blockquote>
 
 <p>No human being is completely innocent of the list above. All people have been cowardly, faithless, sexually immoral, idolatrous, and/or dishonest at some point in their lives.</p>
 
 <p>The punishment for our sin against God is <strong>eternal torment in hell</strong>. Suffering in hell is infinite because an offense against an infinitely holy God is <strong>infinitely serious</strong>.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name." (Revelation 14:11)</blockquote>
 
 <p>Sin is a serious problem, and we seem to be in a hopeless situation, because we have absolutely no ability to escape from our sin. But thankfully, there is a solution to sin, Jesus, whom we will learn about
 next.</p>

 <a id="jesus"></a>
 
 <h3>Jesus</h3>
 
 <p class="first">Jesus is both <strong>fully God</strong> and <strong>fully human</strong>. In the verses below, Jesus is "the Word."</p>
 
 <blockquote>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and <strong>the Word was God</strong> ." (John 1:1)</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>"And <strong>the Word became flesh</strong> and dwelt among us..." (John 1:14a)</blockquote>
 
 <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/5nErEwj.png" class="image image-left" height="200" width="300"></amp-img>

 <p>Jesus accomplished two primary things during his life to save sinners. First, on the cross, he became a <strong>substitute sacrifice</strong> for the sins of all who would believe in him. In other words, he paid the punishment for sin in their place so that they no longer need to pay it themselves in hell. This concept of Jesus "satisfying" God's justice and wrath is called <strong>propitiation</strong> in the Bible.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the <strong>propitiation for our sins</strong> ." (1 John 4:10)</blockquote>
 
 <p>Second, Jesus lived a perfectly righteous life, and through faith, his perfect righteousness is <strong>imputed</strong>, or credited, to us, so that God now sees us as also being perfectly righteous. So, Jesus not only rescues us from our sin, but he also gives us a positive righteousness that enables us to have favor with God.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his <strong>faith is counted as righteousness</strong> ." (Romans 4:5)</blockquote>
 
 <p>It is important to recognize that it is <strong>Jesus' work alone</strong> that saves us, and not Jesus' work <strong>plus</strong> our works. We do not contribute anything to our salvation, which means that God gets all the glory for our salvation.</p>
 
 <p>Next, we will cover the role of <strong>repentance</strong> and <strong>faith</strong> in salvation.</p>

 <a id="salvation"></a>
 
 <h3> Salvation</h3>
 
 <p class="first">Jesus taught that to be saved, we must <strong>repent</strong> and <strong>believe</strong> the gospel.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; <strong>repent</strong> and <strong>believe</strong> in the gospel." (Mark 1:15)</blockquote>
 
 <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/ehOOkvf.png" class="image image-right" height="157" width="300"></amp-img>
 
 <p>To <strong>repent</strong> means to feel sorrow for and hatred toward your sin and to actively turn away from your sin and toward obedience to God.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation..." (2 Corinthians 7:10)</blockquote>
 
 <p>To <strong>believe</strong>, or to have <strong>faith</strong>, means to trust in Jesus' work <strong>alone</strong> for your salvation, and not in <strong>any</strong> of your own good works.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God not a result of works, so that no one may boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9)</blockquote>
 
 <p>Although repentance and faith are actions we must take to be saved, it is God who gives us the ability to repent and have faith. God takes the initiative in giving us new life so that we can take these actions to be saved.</p>
 
 <blockquote>Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."'(John 3:3)</blockquote>
 
 <p>If you find that you have a desire to turn from your sin towards obedience to God, and you realize that you can only be saved by believing, or trusting, in Jesus' saving work, then you are experiencing the results of being "born again," or saved, by God. This is incredibly exciting!</p>
 
 <p>Next, we will talk about the next steps to take in your lifelong journey to learn more about the God of the Bible.</p>

 <a id="next"></a>
 
 <h3>Next Steps</h3>
 
 <p class="first">The most important thing to do as one who believes in Jesus is to <strong>continue learning about and obeying the Bible</strong>. Being a Christian is a lifelong journey and not merely a one-time decision or prayer.</p>
 
 <blockquote>"And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent." (John 17:3)</blockquote>
 
 <amp-img src="https://i.imgur.com/0aerGX6.png" class="image image-left" height="169" width="300"></amp-img>

 <p>Eternal life, or heaven, is about "knowing" God, which means that there is no end to this endeavor. Visit the "Resources" page below for a list of great resources to continue learning about God through the Bible.</p>
 
 <p><a href="/resources/learn" class="link">Resources: Learn</a></p>
 
 <p>In addition to continuing to learn about the Bible, you should find a solid church where you can fellowship and share life with other believers. The Bible is clear that we should be regularly meeting with other believers:</p>
 
 <blockquote>"And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near." (Hebrews 10:24-25)</blockquote>
