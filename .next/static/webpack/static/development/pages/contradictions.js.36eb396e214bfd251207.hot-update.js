    question: "Did all of Egypt's livestock die?",
    quickAnswer: "<p>There are at least five possible explanations:</p>\n  \n      <ol>\n        <li>\"All\" may not refer to every single animal (see Matthew 3:5, Mark 1:5).</li>\n        <li>The Egyptians gained livestock between verses 1-7 and verses 18-21.</li>\n        <li>Only livestock \"in the field\" were killed, so some livestock survived.</li>\n        <li>Verses 1-7 do not mention one important animal: the goat. It is possible that goats were not killed in verses 1-7.</li>\n        <li>In verses 19-20, those who \"feared the word of the Lord\" were warned about the coming plague. Perhaps some were warned during the plague in verses 1-7 also.</li>\n      </ol>",
