The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil...`,
            `18 Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” 19 <strong>Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens</strong> and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.`

      question: "Are there one or many Gods?",
      quickAnswer:
        '<p>The doctrine of the Trinity teaches that there is one God who exists in three persons. "God" and "person" are not the same thing, so there is no contradiction. The plural pronouns in Genesis could either be referring to the Trinity, or they could be a "royal we," which is sometimes used for monarchs.</p>',
