      question: `Did all of Egypt's livestock die?`,
      quickAnswer: `<p>There are at least five possible explanations:</p>
  
      <ol>
        <li>"All" may not refer to every single animal (see Matthew 3:5, Mark 1:5).</li>
        <li>The Egyptians gained livestock between verses 1-7 and verses 18-21.</li>
        <li>Only livestock "in the field" were killed, so some livestock survived.</li>
        <li>Verses 1-7 do not mention one important animal: the goat. It is possible that goats were not killed in verses 1-7.</li>
        <li>In verses 19-20, those who "feared the word of the Lord" were warned about the coming plague. Perhaps some were warned during the plague in verses 1-7 also.</li>

But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.`

      question: `Is God a God of peace or a God of war?`,
      quickAnswer: `<p>God's ultimate plan is peace, but there is a spiritual war that must be fought before full peace arrives. Thus, God is both a God of peace and a God of war. There is simply no contradiction between these passages.</p>`,
