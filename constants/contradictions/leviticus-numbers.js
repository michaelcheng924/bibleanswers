      question: `Do the badger and the rabbit chew the cud?`,
      quickAnswer: `The Bible's definition of "chews the cud" is simply different from the technical definition we are thinking of. When the Bible says that the rabbit (or hare) and rock badger "chew the cud," it is simply saying that they make a chewing motion that looks like what other animals do when they "chew the cud." There is nothing wrong here because the Bible sometimes speaks generically and does not claim to be a technical or scientific textbook.`,

      quickAnswer: `The Bible is simply defining "bird" as an animal that flies and not according to our modern, technical definition of "bird." The Bible does not claim to be a scientific or technical manual, so there is no problem with this classification.`,

      question: `Was it immoral for the Israelites to destroy all the people, including women and children, in the cities they captured?`,
      quickAnswer: `<p>There are at least three responses to the assertion that God was wrong to command the destruction of entire cities, including women and children:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Every human deserves punishment (death/hell) because of sin, including women and children. God does nothing wrong when His command results in an earlier punishment or death in a person's life because that is what that person ultimately deserves.</li>
        <li>One reason for the destruction of entire cities, including women and children, was to keep Israel pure from temptation and idolatry that could easily have arisen from cohabitation with other nations.</li>
        <li>Those who argue that God was wrong to command these things do not have an objective moral standard upon which to say that what God commanded was wrong.</li>
