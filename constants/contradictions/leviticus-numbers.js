      question: `Do the badger and the rabbit chew the cud?`,
      quickAnswer: `The Bible's definition of "chews the cud" is simply different from the technical definition we are thinking of. When the Bible says that the rabbit (or hare) and rock badger "chew the cud," it is simply saying that they make a chewing motion that looks like what other animals do when they "chew the cud." There is nothing wrong here because the Bible sometimes speaks generically and does not claim to be a technical or scientific textbook.`,
