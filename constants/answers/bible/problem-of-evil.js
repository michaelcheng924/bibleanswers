    <h3>What is the problem of evil?</h3>
    <p class="first">
      The "problem of evil" is this:
      <ol>
        <li>The Bible teaches that God is love and that He is all-powerful.</li>
        <li>
          If God is love and He is all-powerful, then evil and suffering would
          not exist in the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          Evil and suffering exist in the world. Therefore, the God of the Bible
          does not exist.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>The solution to the "problem"</h3>
    <p class="first">
      The solution to the "problem of evil" is that #1 above does not necessary
      result in #2. It is true that the Bible teaches that God is love (1 John
      4:8) and that God is all-powerful (Jeremiah 32:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, that God is love and that He is all-powerful does not necessarily
      mean that evil and suffering would not exist in the world. There is
      another possible conclusion, namely, that{" "}
      <B>God has a good purpose for the existence of evil and sufference</B>.
    </p>

    <img src="http://bibleanswers-backend.herokuapp.com/images/purpose.png" class="image-left" />

    <p>
      What could this good purpose be? Well, the Bible teaches that evil and
      suffering result in both God's glory (in Jesus being the ultimate
      conquerer of evil and suffering) and greater joy for God's people (who
      experience firsthand God saving them from their own evil and granting them
      the joy of being a redeemed people who will spend eternity in heaven).
    </p>
    <p>
      Colossians 2:13-15, illustrates that sin (which includes evil and
      suffering) can have a good purpose because in this passage, we see God
      "triumphing" over sin (which exhibits God's glory), which produces joy in
      God's people (who have been "made alive" and "forgiven"). Without the
      existence of sin, evil, and suffering, these two things could not happen.
    </p>
    <h32>Colossians 2:13-15</h32>
    <blockquote>
      And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your
      flesh, God <B>made alive</B> together with him, having <B>forgiven</B> us
      all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us
      with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He
      disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by{" "}
      <B>triumphing</B> over them in him.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>
      "But those good things aren't worth the amount of evil and suffering that
      exist in the world!"
    </h3>
    <p class="first">
      The answer given above to the "problem of evil" does not neglect the fact
      that there is a tremendous amount of evil and suffering in the world, and
      that we should feel deep empathy for those who are suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the answer does demonstrate that the Bible is not
      self-contradictory regarding the "problem of evil." The idea that God's
      good purposes are not worth the amount of evil and suffering that exist in
      the world is a subjective opinion without any real justification.
    </p>

    <h3>
      To the objector: Where do you get your definition of evil?
    </h3>
    <p class="first">
      If one of your objections to the Bible is the "problem of evil," where do
      you get your definition of evil in the first place? Christians believe
      that God has revealed the definition of good and evil through the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not believe in God, then what is your basis for believing in
      good and evil in the first place? If humans are simply the product of
      random chance in a cold, uncaring universe where only the fittest survive,
      then why do you think murder, rape, and stealing are wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is that you are stealing principles of morality from the
      Christian worldview, and that you have no moral foundation to stand on
      when you accuse the God of the Bible as being unjust.
    </p>
