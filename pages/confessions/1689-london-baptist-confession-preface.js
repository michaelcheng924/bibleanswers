        <h3>To the Judicious and Impartial Reader</h3>

        <p>
          It is now many years since divers of us (with other sober Christians
          then living and walking in the way of the Lord that we professe) did
          conceive our selves to be under a necessity of Publishing a Confession
          of our Faith, for the information, and satisfaction of those, that did
          not throughly understand what our principles were, or had entertained
          prejudices against our Profession, by reason of the strange
          representation of them, by some men of note, who had taken very wrong
          measures, and accordingly led others into misapprehensions, of us, and
          them: and this was first put forth about the year, 1643. in the name
          of seven Congregations then gathered in London; since which time,
          diverse impressions thereof have been dispersed abroad, and our end
          proposed, in good measure answered, inasmuch as many (and some of
          those men eminent, both for piety and learning) were thereby
          satisfied, that we were no way guilty of those Heterodoxies and
          fundamental errors, which had too frequently been charged upon us
          without ground, or occasion given on our part. And forasmuch, as that
          Confession is not now commonly to be had; and also that many others
          have since embraced the same truth which is owned therein; it was
          judged necessary by us to joyn together in giving a testimony to the
          world; of our firm adhering to those wholesome Principles, by the
          publication of this which is now in your hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          And forasmuch as our method, and manner of expressing our sentiments,
          in this, doth vary from the former (although the substance of the
          matter is the same) we shall freely impart to you the reason and
          occasion thereof. One thing that greatly prevailed with us to
          undertake this work, was (not only to give a full account of our
          selves, to those Christians that differ from us about the subject of
          Baptism, but also) the profit that might from thence arise, unto those
          that have any account of our labors, in their instruction, and
          establishment in the great truths of the Gospel; in the clear
          understanding, and steady belief of which, our comfortable walking
          with God, and fruitfulness before him, in all our ways, is most neerly
          concerned; and therefore we did conclude it necessary to expresse our
          selves the more fully, and distinctly; and also to fix on such a
          method as might be most comprehensive of those things which we
          designed to explain our sense, and belief of; and finding no defect,
          in this regard, in that fixed on by the assembly, and after them by
          those of the Congregational way, we did readily conclude it best to
          retain the same order in our present confession: and also, when we
          observed that those last mentioned, did in their confession (for
          reasons which seemed of weight both to themselves and others) choose
          not only to express their mind in words concurrent with the former in
          sense, concerning all those articles wherein they were agreed, but
          also for the most part without any variation of the terms we did in
          like manner conclude it best to follow their example in making use of
          the very same words with them both, in these articles (which are very
          many) wherein our faith and doctrine is the same with theirs, and this
          we did, the more abundantly, to manifest our consent with both, in all
          the fundamental articles of the Christian Religion, as also with many
          others, whose orthodox confessions have been published to the world;
          on behalf of the Protestants in divers Nations and Cities: and also to
          convince all, that we have no itch to clogge Religion with new words,
          but do readily acquiesce in that form of sound words, which hath been,
          in consent with the holy Scriptures, used by others before us; hereby
          declaring before God, Angels, & Men, our hearty agreement with them,
          in that wholesome Protestant Doctrine, which with so clear evidence of
          Scriptures they have asserted: some things indeed, are in some places
          added, some terms omitted, and some few changed, but these alterations
          are of that nature, as that we need not doubt, any charge or suspition
          of unsoundness in the faith, from any of our brethren upon the account
          of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          In those things wherein we differ from others, we have exprest our
          selves with all candor and plainness that none might entertain
          jealousie of ought secretly lodged in our breasts, that we would not
          the world should be acquainted with; yet we hope we have also observed
          those rules of modesty, and humility, as will render our freedom in
          this respect inoffensive, even to those whose sentiments are different
          from ours.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have also taken care to affix texts of Scripture, in the margin for
          the confirmation of each article in our confession; in which work we
          have studiously indeavoured to select such as are most clear and
          pertinent, for the proof of what is asserted by us: and our earnest
          desire is, that all into whose hands this may come, would follow that
          (never enough commended) example of the noble Bereans, who searched
          the Scriptures daily, that they might find out whether the things
          preached to them were so or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is one thing more which we sincerely professe, and earnestly
          desire credence in, viz. That contention is most remote from our
          design in all that we have done in this matter: and we hope the
          liberty of an ingenuous unfolding our principles, and opening our
          hearts unto our Brethren, with the Scripture grounds on which our
          faith and practise leanes, will by none of them be either denyed to
          us, or taken ill from us. Our whole design is accomplished, if we may
          obtain that Justice, as to be measured in our principles, and
          practise, and the judgement of both by others, according to what we
          have now published; which the Lord (whose eyes are as a flame of fire)
          knoweth to be the doctrine, which with our hearts we must firmly
          believe, and sincerely indeavour to conform our lives to. And oh that
          other contentions being laid asleep, the only care and contention of
          all upon whom the name of our blessed Redeemer is called, might for
          the future be, to walk humbly with their God, and in the exercise of
          all Love and Meekness towards each other, to perfect holyness in the
          fear of the Lord, each one endeavouring to have his conversation such
          as becometh the Gospel; and also suitable to his place and capacity
          vigorously to promote in others the practice of true Religion and
          undefiled in the sight of God and our Father. And that in this
          backsliding day, we might not spend our breath in fruitless complaints
          of the evils of others; but may every one begin at home, to reform in
          the first place our own hearts, and wayes; and then to quicken all
          that we may have influence upon, to the same work; that if the will of
          God were so, none might deceive themselves, by resting in, and
          trusting to, a form of Godliness, without the power of it, and inward
          experience of the efficacy of those truths that are professed by them.
        </p>

        <p>
          And verily there is one spring and cause of the decay of Religion in
          our day, which we cannot but touch upon, and earnestly urge a redresse
          of; and that is the neglect of the worship of God in Families, by
          those to whom the charge and conduct of them is committed. May not the
          grosse ignorance, and instability of many; with the prophaneness of
          others, be justly charged upon their Parents and Masters; who have not
          trained them up in the way wherein they ought to walk when they were
          young? but have neglected those frequent and solemn commands which the
          Lord hath laid upon them so to catechize, and instruct them, that
          their tender years might be seasoned with the knowledge of the truth
          of God as revealed in the Scriptures; and also by their own omission
          of Prayer, and other duties of Religion in their families, together
          with the ill example of their loose conversation, have inured them
          first to a neglect, and then contempt of all Piety and Religion? we
          know this will not excuse the blindness, or wickedness of any; but
          certainly it will fall heavy upon those that have thus been the
          occasion thereof; they indeed dye in their sins; but will not their
          blood be required of those under whose care they were, who yet
          permitted them to go on without warning, yea led them into the paths
          of destruction? and will not the diligence of Christians with respect
          to the discharge of these duties, in ages past, rise up in judgment
          against, and condemn many of those who would be esteemed such now?
        </p>

        <p>
          We shall conclude with our earnest prayer, that the God of all grace,
          will pour out those measures of his holy Spirit upon us, that the
          profession of truth may be accompanyed with the sound belief, and
          diligent practise of it by us; that his name may in all things be
          glorified, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.
